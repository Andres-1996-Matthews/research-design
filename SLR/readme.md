# Assignment
## Conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in Data Science & Computer Science for Scopus Publication

Conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in Data Science and Computer Science for Scopus publication involves a meticulous process of collecting, evaluating, and synthesizing existing research. It starts with defining clear research questions, followed by a comprehensive search of databases to gather relevant studies. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are rigorously applied to ensure the review‚Äôs focus. The selected literature is then critically appraised for quality and relevance. Finally, the findings are synthesized to highlight trends, gaps, and opportunities for future research, ensuring the SLR‚Äôs contribution to the academic community is robust and valuable
