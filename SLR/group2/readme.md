## Abstract
This systematic literature review examines the current overview of machine translation (MT) 
performance for low-resourced and under-resourced languages, addressing the significant 
challenges and limitations these languages face due to limited digital resources and parallel 
corpora. Despite advancements in neural machine translation (NMT), the effectiveness of 
these MT systems on these languages remains constrained, necessitating a comprehensive 
synthesis of existing research to identify effective strategies and methodologies. The review 
follows PRISMA guidelines, systematically searching multiple academic databases for studies 
published between 2019 and 2023. A total of 69 relevant articles were studied to assess the 
MT performance, the challenges encountered, and the effectiveness of used or proposed 
solutions. Findings from the study reveal that while NMT has emerged as a dominant 
approach, its performance is often stalled by the scarcity of training data and Structural 
variability. The review highlights the importance of leveraging monolingual data and adapting 
model architectures to improve translation accuracy. Additionally, it identifies trends in 
research area, including the integration of multilingual sentiment analysis and speech-to-text 
translation systems. This study offers a thorough examination of the present state of MT for 
low-resourced and under-resourced languages. Furthermore, it emphasizes the necessity for 
future research to investigate underrepresented languages and construct datasets that 
encompass a wider range of languages. By fostering collaboration and innovation in this field, 
the study aims to contribute to more effective and equitable translation solutions, ultimately 
enhancing communication across diverse linguistic communities.

Keywords: Machine translation, low-resourced languages, under-resourced languages
