## Abstract
Data science has become an essential discipline, needed for enhancing competitiveness as well as improving organisations and industries operations with the help of advanced analytical tools. This paper provides a systematic review of the current available tools and their efficiency in data science in relation to key areas and methods of this modern and rapidly developing field. The review aims to address three key research questions: what kind of data science algorithms are used in practice and for what purposes, how data science is affecting the decision making and functioning of various industries, and what approaches are effective for an analytics project, as well as the assistance provided by existing tools. Hence, this review gathers knowledge from different peer-reviewed articles, obtained from Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, and IEEE by categorising literature based on the implementation of data science algorithms in industrial environments, measures the impact of such implementations on businesses and assesses the performance and enablers of the predictive analytics tools. The results contribute to the understanding of what data science techniques and tools are available, how they perform in practice, and the areas where further research and development might be useful.
