# Exercise: AI tools

## 1. Comparative Analysis of Literature Search Tools:

#### Objective:
Compare and evaluate the efficiency of different literature search tools in retrieving relevant information in the field of computer science.

#### Instructions:
1. Select a specific research topic within computer science that interests you.
2. Choose four literature search tools to compare (e.g., Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar).
3. Conduct a literature search on your chosen topic using each tool.
4. Document and compare the results in terms of relevance, coverage, and user-friendliness.
5. Write a comprehensive report discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each tool based on your findings.
6. Conclude with recommendations on which tool(s) are most suitable for different research needs.

## 2. Impact Assessment Using Publish or Perish:

### Objective:
Investigate the impact of selected computer science research papers using the Publish or Perish tool, which evaluates research impact through citation metrics.

### Instructions:
1. Identify three influential research papers in a subfield of computer science.
2. Use the Publish or Perish tool to retrieve citation metrics for each paper.
3. Analyze the citation metrics, including h-index, total citations, and citation per year.
4. Discuss the implications of the findings on understanding the impact of the selected papers.
5. Consider factors that may influence citation metrics.
6. Summarize your findings in a report, emphasizing the significance of using citation metrics in assessing research impact.

## 3. Citation Analysis with scite.ai:

### Objective:
Assess the reliability of scientific claims in computer science research using scite.ai, a tool that aids researchers in citation analysis.

### Instructions:
1. Select a set of three research papers in computer science.
2. Use scite.ai to analyze citations and identify citing and cited articles.
3. Evaluate the context in which the selected papers are cited and discuss the reliability of the claims made.
4. Explore how scite.ai contributes to understanding the credibility of the selected papers.
5. Summarize your findings in a report, highlighting the insights gained from the citation analysis.

## 4. Collaborative Research Using Emerging Platforms:

### Objective:
Explore the functionalities of emerging collaborative research platforms in facilitating teamwork and decision-making in computer science research.

### Instructions:
1. Form a virtual research team with classmates or peers.
2. Choose a specific research topic within computer science that interests the team.
3. Use one or more emerging collaborative research platforms (e.g., Zeta Alpha, Consensus.app, Elicit) to collaborate on the chosen topic.
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of the platforms in enhancing teamwork, communication, and decision-making.
5. Document challenges and benefits experienced during the collaborative research process.
6. Present your findings in a report, providing insights into the suitability of these platforms for collaborative research in computer science.

## 5. Biomedical Informatics Literature Review with PubMed:

### Objective:
Conduct a literature review in the field of biomedical informatics using PubMed, a specialized database for biomedical and life sciences research.

### Instructions:
1. Choose a specific aspect of biomedical informatics that interests you.
2. Use PubMed to search for relevant articles and literature on the chosen topic.
3. Compile a list of key papers and summarize their contributions to the field.
4. Analyze the scope and depth of available literature in the chosen area.
5. Identify any gaps or areas where further research is needed.
6. Write a literature review report summarizing the findings and providing insights into the current state of research in biomedical informatics.
