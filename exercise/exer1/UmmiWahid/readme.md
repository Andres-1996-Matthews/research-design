# Exercise 1:  Chapter 1 - Introduction

### Project Title: Adoption Cashless Performance in Malaysia using a Quantitative Approach

### Prepared by: UMMI FARIHAH BINTI ABD WAHID, MCS231032, UmmiWahid

## 1.1 Introduction


## 1.2 Background of the Problem

The term Cashless Economy refers to the economic system where there is very little flow of cash in society and the purchases are predominantly done by electronic media (Khanna, 2017). Ong (2016) stated that consumers will enjoy the freedom of no longer carrying the burden of bringing cash inside their pockets through the evolvement of new technology devices, the transactions can be done conveniently through wireless technology via mobile devices (smartphones). This circumstance somehow will allow the change in the consumers’ behavior where the consumers would reduce the usage of money as a medium exchange for goods and services by allowing electronic transfer payments such as digital cash and e-wallets (Izzaamirah Ishak et al., 2020). Based on England (2022), it was proven that cashless payment systems are growing astoundingly in some countries.

Besides that, the start of cashless payment in Malaysia is around the year of 2003, however, the rise of it just happened recently during the movement control order (MCO) that was imposed to curb the Covid-19 pandemic in 
2020. This is because cashless payment is an alternative payment method that could limit the spread of the virus (Yusoff et al., 2021). However, as stated in Sharon (2019), it takes Malaysia at least 20 years to fully transform into a cashless society. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a change in people’s behavior due to the contagion period, self-isolation, and economic uncertainty which resulted in the boom of the cashless society in Malaysia (Victor Fabius, 2020).

Gomes (2020) said that the Lazada company had 200% growth in the number of new sellers on the platform in just the first half of 2020. Plus, the aversion towards physical contact also drove the cashless payment. Furthermore, Bank Negara Malaysia has contributed to providing the necessary framework to facilitate digital payments. And this past year, the government has started to encourage consumers to adopt e-wallets via various initiatives. As embodied in Malaysia’s Vision 2020, Malaysia aims to become a cashless country, therefore this study intends to see the adoption of a cashless economy in Malaysia. 

## 1.3 Statement of the Problem

Japan, South Korea, China, and the United States are a part of the countries that are recognized by the nation for their developed technology. Racing towards technology has been a competition by the mentioned countries to prove that they are one of the most developed countries. This competition is measured by many variables that will take place. In developing countries, every human being is allowed to communicate beyond limitation with high technology, improving the standard of living and decreasing production national cost thus, this could have a positive impact on the economies of the country (Bahrini & Qaffas, 2019). Instant technology adoption into the society that uses the internet can have a promising impact. The improvement of technology contributes a big help to the country's development. To soar in democracy and reduce poverty, advanced communication can be a big help to the economy (Cackler et al., 2008). Malaysia has been in a good position to achieve this level and being on par with other developed countries. Thus, a cashless economy has been a good practice to move towards a good economy country (Gomes, 2020). 

In this era, cashless payment is prevalent in Malaysia as the option for digital transactions increases. Many types of payment exist in the current economy, and each of them has the role to contribute to the economic transformation (Suhaidi, 2022). Each of the payment methods plays the role of shaping for a cashless economy and the results can be seen where every element is contributing positively or vice versa towards economic growth. The performance of cashless payments needs to be analyzed for better understanding when moving into a cashless economy. There is much evidence to be said that a cashless economy can help enhance economic growth by evaluating its country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)(Ali et al., 2019). 

The usage of cashless payment in Malaysia has been increasing rapidly throughout the century. People are already aware of cashless payments and used it as their main option to pay even before the pandemic Covid-19 strike. It can be seen where most of the retail stores, even government agencies imposed cashless payment for any transactions related to their services (Ng, 2022). However, people are still insisting on traditional payment though they can make cashless payment as their main transaction which is more convenient (Hani, 2022). Although the two types of payment which are cash and cashless payment have been practiced in the economy scene, there must be one of them who has control in the current scene.

This study will check on the performance of cashless payment by examining the degree of dominance among the circulation of cashless payment and cash in Malaysia. In another calculation, the relationship between the cashless economy and economic growth will be identified based on the recorded basic payments indicator of Malaysia. By forecasting the value of GDP and each of the payment variables in Malaysia and following with the calculation on the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of e-payments, thus it can show the movement of e-payments value and the readiness of this country in implementing cashless payment. 


## 1.4 Research Questions

1) What is the performance of cashless payment in Malaysia?
2) What is the relationship between the cashless economy and economic growth in Malaysia?
3) Which one dominates between cashless payment and cash in circulation in Malaysia?
4) When will be Malaysia fully ready for cashless economy in Malaysia?

## 1.5 Objectives of the Research

1) To fit cashless payment data into multiple linear regression assumptions.
2) To identify the relationship between the cashless economy and economic growth in Malaysia.
3) To examine the degree of dominance among cashless payment and cash in circulation in Malaysia.
4) To forecast the readiness performance of cashless payment in Malaysia.

## 1.6 Scope of the Study

The scope of this research will be revolved around the cashless economy in Malaysia. This study is more specified in the cashless economy instead of the whole digital economy because the replacement of cash is being investigated rather than the digital economy that more focusing on becoming paperless. This research also focuses on the cashless economy in Malaysia instead of other countries as the research on the cashless economy in Malaysia is still constrained and have a lot more area to improve on.

Besides, this study uses the multiple linear regression and stochastic dominance approach as other researchers preferred using surveys as their methods. This is because most research papers produced are qualitative research and use qualitative methods as their methodology.

Moreover, there is limited data available regarding the cashless economy due to the company’s confidential information which makes it hard to discover this research in the eye of a cashless company. Therefore, in this research, we used data collected from Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) from 2004 to 2023 including all the payment methods and the GDP that can be used to check economic growth. With the use of this BNM data, we can proceed to discover the cashless economy as a whole. As mentioned in the background of the study, due to the Malaysia Payment Act 2003, the data on cashless payment not disclosed prior to 2003, therefore this will be the limitation of this study.

## 1.7 Significance of the Research

This study shows the importance of cashless payment which can help public users to identify which payment method is more convenient for them to use as. Utilizing cashless payment can increase economic growth by making transactions faster and easier and this would facilitate consumption (Tennant, 2021). Furthermore, public users who practice digital payment can benefit the economy, and with no doubt the economy will benefit to the public users. A study concluded that the economy is more effective when card usage is employed thus leading towards economic growth (Asia, 2013).

In addition, this study provides information for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME)s to change their way of business by implementing better payment transactions. Some of SMEs may still considered cash as their payment and not the other way around although, cashless payment is growing in Malaysia. The main instrument in the study, which is cashless, can help them in enhancing their work environment by reducing labor and time. It was also proven millions of SMEs had sign-ups for QR payment facilities increased by 57% from June 2020 till June 2021 (Asia, 2013). SMEs can also learn that cashless payment can benefit their own business and increase the capacity of people using cashless payment. Therefore, cashless payment has given room for opportunity to thrive, and more sellers can start business electronic-shops (e-shop) to generate more income (Anonymous, 2022).  
Since cashless payment is one of the sources to increase economic growth, it helps the government to reduce the cost of issuing banknotes thus increasing in consumption of GDP (Tennant, 2021). Thus, the government can act by analyzing which method can help economic growth and they can make a move by developing a new policy that can encourage people to use cashless payment. Moreover, this could help to further analysis can be taken from them to prepare for inflation in Malaysia. Not only that this will help Malaysia to be a developed country like other developed countries in which the government can signified the usage of cashless payment towards the people.

## 1.9 Summary

The fundamental goal of this thesis is to examine the implementation of cashless payment in Malaysia, specifically in terms of economic growth and preparation for a cashless economy. The study investigates the performance of cashless payment systems and their effects on Malaysia's economic landscape using data from Bank Negara Malaysia from the period of 2004 to 2023. The research uses quantitative methods such as Multiple Linear Regression and Stochastic Dominance to determine the relationship between cashless transactions and economic indicators, as well as the dominance of cashless payment over physical cash circulation. The report focuses the relevance of digital payment methods in improving transaction efficiency, supporting economic growth, and meeting the changing needs of businesses, notably small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Despite data availability problems, the study emphasises the importance of using reliable data sources to analyse payment trends and aid Malaysia's transition to a cashless economy.
