# Exercise 1:  Chapter 1 - Introduction

### Project Title: Adoption Cashless Performance in Malaysia using a Quantitative Approach

### Prepared by: UMMI FARIHAH BINTI ABD WAHID, MCS231032, UmmiWahid

## 1.1 Introduction


## 1.2 Background of the Problem

The term Cashless Economy refers to the economic system where there is very little flow of cash in society and the purchases are predominantly done by electronic media (Khanna, 2017). Ong (2016) stated that consumers will enjoy the freedom of no longer carrying the burden of bringing cash inside their pockets through the evolvement of new technology devices, the transactions can be done conveniently through wireless technology via mobile devices (smartphones). This circumstance somehow will allow the change in the consumers‚Äô behavior where the consumers would reduce the usage of money as a medium exchange for goods and services by allowing electronic transfer payments such as digital cash and e-wallets (Izzaamirah Ishak et al., 2020). Based on England (2022), it was proven that cashless payment systems are growing astoundingly in some countries.

Besides that, the start of cashless payment in Malaysia is around the year of 2003, however, the rise of it just happened recently during the movement control order (MCO) that was imposed to curb the Covid-19 pandemic in 
2020. This is because cashless payment is an alternative payment method that could limit the spread of the virus (Yusoff et al., 2021). However, as stated in Sharon (2019), it takes Malaysia at least 20 years to fully transform into a cashless society. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a change in people‚Äôs behavior due to the contagion period, self-isolation, and economic uncertainty which resulted in the boom of the cashless society in Malaysia (Victor Fabius, 2020).

Gomes (2020) said that the Lazada company had 200% growth in the number of new sellers on the platform in just the first half of 2020. Plus, the aversion towards physical contact also drove the cashless payment. Furthermore, Bank Negara Malaysia has contributed to providing the necessary framework to facilitate digital payments. And this past year, the government has started to encourage consumers to adopt e-wallets via various initiatives. As embodied in Malaysia‚Äôs Vision 2020, Malaysia aims to become a cashless country, therefore this study intends to see the adoption of a cashless economy in Malaysia.
