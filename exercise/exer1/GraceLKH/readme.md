## 1.1 Introduction

Climate change is defined as any long-standing shifts in temperature, both hot and cold, as well as weather patterns in the earth it is common nowadays to refer to it as one of the most emerging phenomena in the natural environment. Starting from the preceding decades, the changes in climate occur due to climate events such as volcanic eruption, fluctuations in the intensity and distribution of solar energy, and changes in the tilt of the earth. However, since Industrial revolution era, which has taken several centuries, most activities, particularly combustion of fuels and negative impacts such as deforestation have greatly Enhanced activities that have promoted concentration of GHG’s have prompted high rates of change on climate. All these anthropogenic activities over the same have lead to an improvement in the global temperatures, changes in precipitation, as well as the magnitude and frequency of occurrence to extreme weather conditions.

Another aspect of climate change has to do with this article since the occurrence of forest fires are said to become more frequent and intense. Wildfires or more commonly, forest fires refers to those outdoor ignition of vegetation and they are defined as blazing, intensely hot and have a high rate of spread fires that occurs in a vegetative cover such as forests. These fires can be due to natural occurrences for example as can be observed in dry seasons, while others are owned to human uses such as fire clearing and accidental cause of fires. Climate change works hand in hand with forest fires through factors such as high temperatures, low humidity, shorter times between occurrences in rain and with longer durations of drought and change of winds that enhance the fire making environment.

Wildfires have been part of the Earth’s history for a long time now and although they are destructive to wildlife and human property, they are vital in several ways to the ecosystem. Many of the fires kindled by the native Americans hundreds of years back cannot be ‘today’s forest fires in terms of its intensity and impacts, which are caused by humans and change in climate. Turning to historical events, the Great Fire in 1910 took place in the USA, and the Ash Wednesday Bushfires in 1983 – in Australia; all these facts, along with the recent 2019-2020 Australian Bushfire Season testify to the increase in the frequency of fires and consequently, to the need to develop and improve the methods of fire management.

Due to its tropical weather that is known for high humidity and temperature, Peninsular Malaysia experiences a heightened risk of forest fires during dry spells. Forest fires have been an issue in the region for decades with early incidents related to slash-and-burn farming practices, which were initially minor and localized but became more frequent and intense due as urbanization increased along with deforestation and climatic changes. Severe droughts in 1983-1984, El Niño event of 1997-1998 fire season of 2005, plus peatland blazes in Johor & Selangor backdropped concerns about managing such environmental hazards by highlighting the forests' vulnerability when faced with varying climates throughout history.

In the past, forest fires were thought of as entirely natural events, and efforts to combat them focused mainly on suppression rather than prevention. As time went on, attitudes shifted toward acknowledging the ecological significance of fire in forest management. Consequently, prescribed burns became a popular tool for maintaining healthy forests during the mid-20th century. Recent developments in data collection and analytical techniques have allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of how climate variables interact with wildfires. This improved knowledge has spurred more proactive strategies for managing these hazards effectively. Modern technologies such as remote sensing, GIS systems and machine learning technology are now essential components that play an active role predicting  and addressing wildfire outbreaks within our precious national landscapes today.’

Forest fires in Peninsular Malaysia pose a significant threat to biodiversity, human health, and the economy. However, despite being aware of climatic factors' influence on forest fire occurrences in this region, research focusing specifically on temporal patterns and climate influences has been limited. Addressing this problem is crucial due to various reasons. Environmentally speaking, habitat destruction caused by fires leads to loss of biodiversity as well as degradation of soil quality. Public health also faces severe risks with smoke inhalation from burning pollutants causing respiratory issues while economically; the tourism sector gets negatively affected along with considerable timber resource damage. Mitigating these impacts through effective fire management strategies promotes sustainable development but there's still much work needed considering how dangerous uncontrolled forest burns can be (as evidenced by recent events like those seen at Australia or Amazon). Therefore predictive models are necessary for dealing proactively against such incidents than reacting late afterward!

This project aims to explore the impact of climate on forest fires in Peninsular Malaysia. The central research question that will be pursued is how climatic variables affect temporal patterns regarding these incidents. To address this inquiry, we intend to achieve several objectives like collecting a comprehensive dataset relating to historical forest fire occurrences and relevant climatic data spanning over recent decades while analyzing any apparent trends or distinctive temporal characteristics observed. Furthermore, our goals include quantifying the relationship between these phenomena more accurately and developing predictive models for identifying possible risk factors based on prevailing weather conditions leading up to such scenarios' emergence; ultimately aiding us with appropriate recommendations towards achieving better management strategies as preventive measures against future calamities effectively.

This study concentrates on Peninsular Malaysia and spans at least 3 years to analyze various climatic factors, including temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed. However, historical data may contain inaccuracies or gaps in information while the exclusion of East Malaysia is due to varying ecological conditions. The anticipated results are predictive models aimed at evaluating forest fire hazards within this region.

Studies conducted in multiple regions have investigated the correlation between forest fires and climatic factors; however, research specific to Peninsular Malaysia is scarce. Past investigations commonly suffered from incomplete data sets and lacked advanced analytical techniques. This study intends to close these gaps by employing machine learning along with time series analysis for forecasting fire hazards, ascertaining instances of wildfires and climatic indicators within Peninsular Malaysia. The aim is not just to bridge those gaps but also produce an informative contribution towards environmental management while improving our understanding regarding alterations observed in fruitfulness combustion incidents against changes in climate conditions.

## 1.2 Background of the Problem

Forest fires, exacerbated by climate change, have become a critical environmental and socio-economic issue in many regions, including Peninsular Malaysia. These fires pose severe threats to biodiversity, human health, and the economy. The increasing frequency and intensity of forest fires due to rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and other climatic factors necessitate a deeper understanding of their underlying causes and patterns. This research is particularly important for developing effective fire management strategies, mitigating environmental damage, and protecting public health and economic assets.

Several studies have explored the relationship between climatic variables and forest fires in various regions. For instance, "Climate Change and Forest Fires in the Mediterranean Basin: How Will Fire Weather Change?" (Turco et al. , 2012) investigated the influence of climate change on fire weather in the Mediterranean. The study found that increased temperatures and reduced precipitation significantly heightened fire risk, using statistical models to predict future fire weather scenarios. Similarly, "Impact of Climate Change on Forest Fire Regimes in Canada" (Flannigan et al., 2005) highlighted the increasing frequency and severity of forest fires due to rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, employing a combination of historical fire data and climate models. In "Modeling the Effects of Climate Change on Fire Activity in the Alaskan Boreal Forest" (Balshi et al., 2009), the researchers used dynamic vegetation models to predict fire activity under various climate change scenarios, concluding that fire frequency and area burned would increase significantly. These studies underscore the critical role of climatic variables in influencing forest fire patterns and the need for region-specific research to develop effective management strategies.

## 1.3 Statement of the Problem

Despite the recognition of climatic factors as critical influencers of forest fire occurrences globally, there is limited research specifically focused on the temporal patterns and climatic influences of forest fires in Peninsular Malaysia.
