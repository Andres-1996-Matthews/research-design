# Exercise: NABC Model

Here's the NABC Model Exercise with related emojis added to each section for a more engaging presentation:

## NABC Model Exercise: Individual Project Proposal Development üöÄ

This exercise will guide you through developing a project proposal using the NABC Model (Need, Approach, Benefit, Competition). This model serves as a framework to clearly define your data science project and its potential impact.

**Instructions:**

**1. Team Formation (Optional):** üë•

This exercise is designed for individual work. However, if you prefer, you can form a team of **maximum two** students to develop your proposal collaboratively.

**2. Data Science Project Selection:** üéØ

  - Choose a real-world problem you'd like to address using data science techniques. This can be related to your field of study, personal interests, or current events.

**3. NABC Model Breakdown:** üìù

**Deliverable:** Your completed NABC Model.

**a) Need (20 Points):** ü§î

* Define the problem you want to solve. Be specific and explain the impact of this problem.
* Briefly discuss any relevant data sources you might utilize.
* Why is this problem important? Who are the stakeholders affected by this problem?

**b) Approach (30 Points):** üí°

* Describe your proposed solution in detail. How will you leverage data science techniques to address the identified need?
* What specific data science tools, algorithms, or methods do you plan to employ?
* Explain the steps involved in your approach (data acquisition, pre-processing, analysis, etc.)

**c) Benefit Over Cost (25 Points):** üí∏

* Describe the anticipated benefits of your proposed solution.
* How will your solution address the identified need in a way that's better than existing solutions (if any)?
* Consider both tangible and intangible benefits (e.g., increased efficiency, improved decision-making).
* Discuss the potential costs associated with implementing your solution (e.g., computational resources, data collection efforts). Demonstrate how the benefits outweigh the costs.

**d) Competition (25 Points):** üèÜ

* Are there existing solutions or approaches that address the same problem?
* If so, what are their strengths and weaknesses?
* How will your solution differentiate itself from the competition?
* How will your data science approach offer a novel angle to achieve better results?

**4. Deliverables:** üìä

* Submit a well-structured document outlining your NABC Model for your chosen data science project.
* Ensure your document addresses each aspect clearly and concisely.

**5. Tips for Success:** üåü

* Conduct thorough research to understand the problem and existing solutions.
* Be specific and provide details about your proposed approach and methodology.
* Clearly demonstrate the value proposition of your project by highlighting the benefits.
* Be creative and innovative in your approach to set your project apart.

**Remember:** This exercise serves as a foundation for developing your data science project proposal.

**Good luck!** üçÄ
