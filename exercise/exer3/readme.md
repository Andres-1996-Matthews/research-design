# Exercise: NABC Model üöÄ

This exercise will guide you through developing a project proposal using the NABC Model (Need, Approach, Benefit, Competition). This model serves as a framework to clearly define your data science project and its potential impact.

## Instructions:

### 1. Data Science Project Selection üéØ

  - Choose a real-world problem you'd like to address using data science techniques. This can be related to your field of study, personal interests, or current events.

### 2. NABC Model Breakdown üìù

**Deliverable:** Your completed NABC Model.

**a) Need (20 Points):** ü§î

* Define the problem you want to solve. Be specific and explain the impact of this problem.
* Briefly discuss any relevant data sources you might utilize.
* Why is this problem important? Who are the stakeholders affected by this problem?

**b) Approach (30 Points):** üí°

* Describe your proposed solution in detail. How will you leverage data science techniques to address the identified need?
* What specific data science tools, algorithms, or methods do you plan to employ?
* Explain the steps involved in your approach (data acquisition, pre-processing, analysis, etc.)

**c) Benefit Over Cost (25 Points):** üí∏

* Describe the anticipated benefits of your proposed solution.
* How will your solution address the identified need in a way that's better than existing solutions (if any)?
* Consider both tangible and intangible benefits (e.g., increased efficiency, improved decision-making).
* Discuss the potential costs associated with implementing your solution (e.g., computational resources, data collection efforts). Demonstrate how the benefits outweigh the costs.

**d) Competition (25 Points):** üèÜ

* Are there existing solutions or approaches that address the same problem?
* If so, what are their strengths and weaknesses?
* How will your solution differentiate itself from the competition?
* How will your data science approach offer a novel angle to achieve better results?

### 3. Visual elements üìà
Adding visual elements to your NABC Model document can make it more engaging and easier to understand. Here are some suggestions for incorporating visual elements:

- **Charts and Graphs**: Use charts and graphs to represent data, trends, or comparisons related to your project.
- **Diagrams**: Include flowcharts or diagrams to illustrate the steps of your approach or the structure of your solution.
- **Images**: Add relevant images to break up text and add visual interest.
- **Tables**: Organize data or comparison points in tables for clarity.
- **Infographics**: Create infographics to summarize complex information in a visually appealing way.
- **Bold and Italics**: Use bold and italics to emphasize key points or terms.
- **Bullet Points**: Use bullet points to list features, benefits, or other important elements.

### 4. Deliverables üìä

* Submit a well-structured document outlining your NABC Model for your chosen data science project.
* Ensure your document addresses each aspect clearly and concisely.
* Submit your completed exercise in the `exer3` folder. Ensure your document is correctly formatted and includes all required subtopics. Within the [`exer3`]() folder, create a folder with your GitHub ID. Name the file as `readme.md`.

  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑreadme.md
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅyour github id
```

### 5. Tips for Success üåü
* Conduct thorough research to understand the problem and existing solutions.
* Be specific and provide details about your proposed approach and methodology.
* Clearly demonstrate the value proposition of your project by highlighting the benefits.
* Be creative and innovative in your approach to set your project apart.

**Remember:** This exercise serves as a foundation for developing your data science project proposal.

**Good luck!** üçÄ
