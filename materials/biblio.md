# Bibliometrix
"Bibliometrix" is an **R-tool** designed for comprehensive **science mapping analysis**. It's a package within the R programming language, which is widely used for statistical computing and graphics. Bibliometrix provides a suite of tools for **quantitative research** in bibliometrics and scientometrics.

Here's what Bibliometrix offers:
- **Data Collection**: It starts with data collection from various bibliographic databases like Scopus and Web of Science.
- **Data Analysis**: After data upload, it allows for a range of analyses, including statistical analysis, data preprocessing, and construction of co-occurrence matrices.
- **Visualization**: Bibliometrix can generate dynamic graphs and visual representations to help understand the data better.
- **Biblioshiny**: This is a web-based interface that encapsulates the core code of Bibliometrix, allowing users to perform bibliometric analysis interactively.

Bibliometrix is particularly useful for analyzing publication datasets, building matrices for co-citation, coupling, collaboration, and co-word analysis. These matrices are then used for network analysis, multiple correspondence analysis, and other data reduction techniques¬≤. It's a powerful tool for researchers and academics looking to evaluate scientific literature comprehensively.

## Installation
Installing Bibliometrix is a straightforward process if you follow these steps:

1. **Install R**: You need to have R installed on your computer. You can download the most recent version of R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).

2. **Install RStudio (Optional)**: While not necessary, RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for R. You can download it from the [RStudio website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

3. **Install Bibliometrix**:
   - Open R or RStudio.
   - In the console, type the following command and press Enter:
     ```R
     install.packages("bibliometrix")
     ```
   - If prompted, select a CRAN mirror that is closest to your location for a faster download.

4. **Load Bibliometrix**:
   - Once installed, load Bibliometrix by typing the following command in the R console:
     ```R
     library(bibliometrix)
     ```

5. **Launch Biblioshiny (Optional)**:
   - Biblioshiny is the web-based interface for Bibliometrix. To launch it, enter the following command in the R console:
     ```R
     biblioshiny()
     ```

This will open Biblioshiny in your default web browser, allowing you to perform bibliometric analysis using a graphical interface without the need for coding¬≥.

For a more detailed guide, you can watch instructional videos available online that walk you through the installation and usage of Bibliometrix and Biblioshiny¬π¬≤¬≥. Remember to check for any specific system requirements or dependencies that might be needed for your operating system.
