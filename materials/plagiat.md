# Plagiarism Policy 🚫

Plagiarism is the act of copying or using someone else’s work, ideas, or words without proper citation or acknowledgment. It is a serious academic offense that may lead to penalties such as failing grades, suspension, or even expulsion. Plagiarism undermines the integrity of your work and is unacceptable in academic writing. 😞

For your project report:
- **Overall plagiarism percentage must be below 20% 📉**
- **AI-generated plagiarism must be 0% 🚫🤖**

To avoid plagiarism:
1. **Credit Original Sources**: Use quotation marks, paraphrase, or summarize content, and always cite sources correctly. ✅
2. **Use a Standard Citation Style**: Adhere to APA, MLA, or Chicago citation styles. 📚
3. **Check Your Work**: Before submission, review your citations and ensure originality. 🔍
