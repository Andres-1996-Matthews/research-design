# Journal Indexing

Journal indexing is a critical aspect of academic publishing that affects the visibility, credibility, and impact of research. Here's an overview of what journal indexing entails:

## What is Journal Indexing?
Journal indexing refers to the inclusion of a journal in a database or a collection of journals. These databases are often searchable and allow researchers, scholars, and the general public to find articles for their research needs. Indexed journals are typically considered to be of higher scientific quality than non-indexed journals.

## How Does a Journal Get Indexed?
Journals undergo a rigorous evaluation process to be indexed. The criteria for indexing may include:
- **Ethics and Peer Review Policies**: Journals must have clear and strict peer review processes and ethical guidelines.
- **Editorial Board Transparency**: The editorial board's qualifications and processes must be transparent.
- **Assessment Criteria for Submitted Articles**: There should be clear criteria for the acceptance and rejection of articles.

## Key Types of Journal Indexes
There are several types of journal indexes, including:
- **General Indexes**: Broad coverage across multiple disciplines (e.g., Web of Science Core Collection).
- **Specialized Indexes**: Focus on specific fields or regions (e.g., Science Citation Index Expanded for science and technology journals).

## Major Indexing Databases

### Web of Science (WoS)
The **Web of Science** (WoS) is a prestigious database that provides a comprehensive citation search. It allows researchers to search for articles from thousands of high-impact journals worldwide. WoS includes several indices such as:
- **Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE)**
- **Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI)**
- **Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI)**
- **Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI)**

Journals indexed in WoS are considered to be of high quality due to rigorous selection criteria that include:
- Peer-review
- Editorial content
- Citation data

### Scopus
**Scopus** is another extensive abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature. It covers:
- Scientific journals
- Books
- Conference proceedings

Scopus offers:
- **Author profiles** which include details about publications and citation data.
- **Journal metrics**, such as CiteScore, SJR (SCImago Journal Rank), and SNIP (Source Normalized Impact per Paper).

### Non-Indexed Journals
Non-indexed journals are those not included in major databases like WoS or Scopus. They may still be peer-reviewed but do not have the same level of recognition or visibility. Researchers should be cautious when publishing in non-indexed journals, as they may not undergo the same rigorous review process.

### Importance of Journal Indexing
Journal indexing is crucial for:
- **Visibility**: Indexed journals are more visible to the research community.
- **Credibility**: Indexing acts as a mark of quality and credibility.
- **Impact**: Articles in indexed journals are more likely to be cited.

When choosing a journal for publication, it's essential to consider whether it's indexed in a recognized database to ensure the widest possible dissemination and impact of your research.

## Comparison table

| Feature | Web of Science (WoS) | Scopus | Non-Indexed Journals |
|---------|----------------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Coverage** | Selective (high-impact journals) | Extensive (includes a wide range of sources) | Varies widely |
| **Citation Tracking** | Comprehensive citation analysis | Detailed citation analysis | Limited or none |
| **Journal Metrics** | Impact Factor, Eigenfactor, JCR | CiteScore, SJR, SNIP | Not available |
| **Peer Review** | Rigorous peer review process | Rigorous peer review process | Varies, not always transparent |
| **Recognition** | High recognition in academia | High recognition in academia | Lower recognition |
| **Visibility** | High visibility among researchers | High visibility among researchers | Lower visibility |
| **Database Access** | Subscription-based | Subscription-based | Often open access or subscription-based |
| **Selection Criteria** | Strict selection criteria | Comprehensive selection criteria | Criteria may not be well-defined |
| **APC** | Varies (some journals may charge) | Varies (some journals may charge) | Often lower or no charge |

APCs are most commonly associated with open access articles, where the fee may be paid by the author, the author's institution, or their research funder. The global average per-journal APC is approximately **USD 1,626**, but this can range from under $100 to over $5,000, with some journals like Nature charging up to ‚Ç¨9,500.

Please note that while APCs are common in open access publishing, they are not exclusive to it. Some subscription-based journals also charge APCs for open access options within their journals, often referred to as "hybrid" open access.
