# Journal Indexing
Certainly! Here's a detailed description of journal indexing in Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and non-indexed journals, presented in markdown format:

### Web of Science (WoS)
The **Web of Science** (WoS) is a prestigious database that provides a comprehensive citation search. It allows researchers to search for articles from thousands of high-impact journals worldwide. WoS includes several indices such as:
- **Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE)**
- **Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI)**
- **Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI)**
- **Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI)**

Journals indexed in WoS are considered to be of high quality due to rigorous selection criteria that include:
- Peer-review
- Editorial content
- Citation data

To explore journals indexed in WoS, you can visit the [Web of Science Master Journal List](^1^).

### Scopus
**Scopus** is another extensive abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature. It covers:
- Scientific journals
- Books
- Conference proceedings

Scopus offers:
- **Author profiles** which include details about publications and citation data.
- **Journal metrics**, such as CiteScore, SJR (SCImago Journal Rank), and SNIP (Source Normalized Impact per Paper).

For a list of journals indexed by Scopus, you can refer to resources like the [Scopus list](^2^) provided by various institutions.

### Non-Indexed Journals
Non-indexed journals are those not included in major databases like WoS or Scopus. They may still be peer-reviewed but do not have the same level of recognition or visibility. Researchers should be cautious when publishing in non-indexed journals, as they may not undergo the same rigorous review process.

### Importance of Journal Indexing
Journal indexing is crucial for:
- **Visibility**: Indexed journals are more visible to the research community.
- **Credibility**: Indexing acts as a mark of quality and credibility.
- **Impact**: Articles in indexed journals are more likely to be cited.

When choosing a journal for publication, it's essential to consider whether it's indexed in a recognized database to ensure the widest possible dissemination and impact of your research.

## Comparison table

| Feature | Web of Science (WoS) | Scopus | Non-Indexed Journals |
|---------|----------------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Coverage** | Selective (high-impact journals) | Extensive (includes a wide range of sources) | Varies widely |
| **Citation Tracking** | Comprehensive citation analysis | Detailed citation analysis | Limited or none |
| **Journal Metrics** | Impact Factor, Eigenfactor, JCR | CiteScore, SJR, SNIP | Not available |
| **Peer Review** | Rigorous peer review process | Rigorous peer review process | Varies, not always transparent |
| **Recognition** | High recognition in academia | High recognition in academia | Lower recognition |
| **Visibility** | High visibility among researchers | High visibility among researchers | Lower visibility |
| **Database Access** | Subscription-based | Subscription-based | Often open access or subscription-based |
| **Selection Criteria** | Strict selection criteria | Comprehensive selection criteria | Criteria may not be well-defined |
| **APC** | Varies (some journals may charge) | Varies (some journals may charge) | Often lower or no charge |

APCs are most commonly associated with open access articles, where the fee may be paid by the author, the author's institution, or their research funder. The global average per-journal APC is approximately **USD 1,626**, but this can range from under $100 to over $5,000, with some journals like Nature charging up to ‚Ç¨9,500.

Please note that while APCs are common in open access publishing, they are not exclusive to it. Some subscription-based journals also charge APCs for open access options within their journals, often referred to as "hybrid" open access¬π.
