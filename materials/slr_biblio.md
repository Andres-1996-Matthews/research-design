# SLR VS bibliometric research

| **Aspect**                 | **SLR (Systematic Literature Review)**                              | **Bibliometric Analysis**                                             |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose and Focus**       | Provides a comprehensive summary and critical analysis of research  | Quantitatively analyzes publication, citation, and collaboration data |
| **Nature**                  | Qualitative                                                        | Quantitative                                                         |
| **Methodology**             | Systematic search, selection, and critical appraisal of studies     | Statistical analysis of citation data, co-authorship, and keywords    |
| **Data Source**             | Selected studies based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria   | Databases (e.g., Web of Science, Scopus)                             |
| **Outcome**                 | Detailed narrative review highlighting gaps and research trends     | Identifies key authors, influential works, and emerging trends        |
| **Strengths**               | In-depth, critical synthesis of existing research                   | Provides big-picture view, data-driven insights                       |
| **Limitations**             | Time-consuming, potentially subjective                             | Focuses on quantity, may overlook content and quality of research     |
| **Visual Representation**   | Narrative reports, thematic analysis                               | Citation maps, co-occurrence networks                                 |
| **Typical Fields of Use**   | Medicine, social sciences, education                                | Scientometrics, research evaluation                                  |
| **Common Tools**            | PRISMA guidelines, thematic analysis                               | VOSviewer, Bibliometrix, CitNetExplorer                              |
