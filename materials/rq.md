Here are the key characteristics to keep in mind when crafting a research question that shines:

‚úÖ Clear and focused: No more beating around the bush! Your question should be crystal clear, leaving no room for ambiguity or confusion.

‚úÖ Researchable:  Can it be answered through empirical investigation? Your question should be just the right blend of specific and broad to allow for thorough exploration.

‚úÖ Relevant and meaningful: Does it tackle a significant gap or problem in your field? Your question should contribute meaningfully to existing knowledge.

‚úÖ Objective and unbiased: Keep it impartial! Your question should be free from personal biases, ensuring a fair exploration of the topic.

‚úÖ Feasible: Keep it real! Ensure your question can be tackled within the constraints of time, resources, and data availability.

‚úÖ Aligned with appropriate methodology: Does it match your chosen research approach? Your question should fit snugly with your methodology of choice.

‚úÖ Ethical: Respect is key! Ensure your question upholds ethical standards, safeguarding the well-being of all involved.

‚úÖ Potentially leading to new insights or discoveries: Will it pave the way for fresh discoveries? Your question should have the potential to uncover new knowledge or perspectives.

‚úÖ Aligned with the researcher's interests and expertise: Does it ignite your passion? Your question should resonate with your interests and skills, driving genuine enthusiasm.

‚úÖ Precise and specific: Leave no room for guesswork! Your question should be laser-focused, avoiding vague terminology.

‚úÖ Testable: Can it stand up to scrutiny? Your question should be ripe for empirical testing, allowing for data-driven conclusions.
