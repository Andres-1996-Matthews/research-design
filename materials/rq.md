# Research Question

A **research question** is a clear, focused, concise, complex, and arguable question around which you center your research. It's the question to which you want to find an answer through your research.

In the field of **computer science**, a research question could be related to various domains such as algorithms, data structures, computer systems, machine learning, artificial intelligence, software engineering, computer graphics, computational complexity, etc.


## Strategies for brainstorming research questions

1. **Identify Your Interest**: Start with a broad field of interest and then narrow down to a specific topic that you are curious about.

2. **Read Existing Literature**: Look at what has already been done in your field of interest. This can help you identify gaps, controversies, or emerging trends that you can explore.

3. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Your research question should be open-ended, meaning it should not be answerable with a simple "yes" or "no". 

4. **Use the 5 Ws**: Consider the who, what, when, where, and why of your topic. This can help you focus your question.

5. **Discuss with Others**: Talk to your professors, colleagues, or classmates about your ideas. They can provide valuable feedback and may suggest angles you hadn't considered.

6. **Relevance to Field**: Ensure that your research question is relevant and significant to your field of study. It should contribute to the existing body of knowledge.

7. **Flexibility**: Be flexible and open to refining your question as you progress in your research. As you learn more about your topic, you may find that your focus shifts slightly.

## Characteristics of a good Research Question

<p align="center">

</p>

✅ Clear and focused: No more beating around the bush! Your question should be crystal clear, leaving no room for ambiguity or confusion.

✅ Researchable:  Can it be answered through empirical investigation? Your question should be just the right blend of specific and broad to allow for thorough exploration.

✅ Relevant and meaningful: Does it tackle a significant gap or problem in your field? Your question should contribute meaningfully to existing knowledge.

✅ Objective and unbiased: Keep it impartial! Your question should be free from personal biases, ensuring a fair exploration of the topic.

✅ Feasible: Keep it real! Ensure your question can be tackled within the constraints of time, resources, and data availability.

✅ Aligned with appropriate methodology: Does it match your chosen research approach? Your question should fit snugly with your methodology of choice.

✅ Ethical: Respect is key! Ensure your question upholds ethical standards, safeguarding the well-being of all involved.

✅ Potentially leading to new insights or discoveries: Will it pave the way for fresh discoveries? Your question should have the potential to uncover new knowledge or perspectives.

✅ Aligned with the researcher's interests and expertise: Does it ignite your passion? Your question should resonate with your interests and skills, driving genuine enthusiasm.

✅ Precise and specific: Leave no room for guesswork! Your question should be laser-focused, avoiding vague terminology.

✅ Testable: Can it stand up to scrutiny? Your question should be ripe for empirical testing, allowing for data-driven conclusions.

## Common pitfalls to avoid when formulating a research question

1. **Too Broad or Too Narrow**: A research question that is too broad can lead to a lack of focus in your research, while a question that is too narrow might not allow for sufficient analysis. It's important to find a balance.

2. **Not Researchable**: The question should be one that can be answered through the research process. If the question is based on personal beliefs or values, it may not be researchable.

3. **Too Complex**: While complexity is good, a question that is overly complex can make your research difficult to manage. It's better to have a clear and concise question that can be expanded upon.

4. **Lack of Originality**: The research question should contribute to the existing body of knowledge in your field. If the question has already been answered, it may not be a good choice for a research project.

5. **Not Linked to Theory**: In many fields, research questions should be tied to existing theories. A question that is not linked to theory may lack depth and significance.

6. **Unethical or Impractical**: The research question should be ethical and practical. If answering the question would involve unethical practices, or if it is not feasible to answer the question due to time, resource, or access constraints, then it may need to be revised.

## Strategies to assess the quality of your research question

1. **Clarity**: Is the research question clear and unambiguous? You should be able to easily understand what is being asked.

2. **Specificity**: Is the research question focused and concise? A good research question should be specific enough to explore in depth within the scope of your project.

3. **Complexity**: Does the research question require analysis, synthesis, and evaluation? It should not be answerable with a simple "yes" or "no", or by easily found facts. It should require thought and the integration of multiple sources.

4. **Arguable**: Is the research question open to debate? It should not be universally accepted as fact and should have more than one potential answer.

5. **Researchable**: Can the research question be answered with the time, resources, and access you have? If not, you may need to refine your question.

6. **Relevance**: Is the research question significant to the field of study? It should contribute to the existing body of knowledge and be of interest to others in the field.

7. **Ethical**: Is the research question ethical? It should not involve any harm to participants or unethical practices in the research process.

## Poorly formulated research questions

1. **"Why is the sky blue?"**: While this might seem like a good question, it's not a good research question for computer science because it's not related to the field. A good research question should be relevant to your field of study.

2. **"Is Python a good programming language?"**: This question is too subjective and could lead to biased results. A better question might be, "What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Python for data analysis?"

3. **"How can we solve world hunger using technology?"**: This question is too broad and complex to be addressed effectively in a single research project. It could be narrowed down to something like, "How can machine learning be used to optimize crop yields?"

4. **"Can computers think?"**: This question is too vague and philosophical. A more specific and researchable question might be, "What are the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence in mimicking human cognitive processes?"

5. **"Will quantum computing become mainstream?"**: This question is speculative and not easily researchable. A better question might be, "What are the current challenges and potential solutions in making quantum computing more accessible?"

## Examples of a research question in Computer Science 

1. **"How can machine learning algorithms be optimized to improve their performance in predicting stock market trends?"**: This question is clear, focused on a specific topic (machine learning and stock market prediction), complex (requires understanding and application of machine learning algorithms), and arguable (different algorithms and optimization techniques can lead to different results).

2. **"What are the security vulnerabilities in cloud computing, and how can they be addressed to make cloud computing safer?"**: This question is specific (focused on security issues in cloud computing), complex (requires a deep understanding of cloud computing and cybersecurity), and arguable (different strategies can be proposed and evaluated).

3. **"How can data mining techniques be applied to large datasets to extract meaningful patterns and insights?"**: This question is clear, focused (on data mining and big data), complex (requires knowledge of data mining techniques and their application), and arguable (the definition of "meaningful" can vary).

4. **"What are the challenges in implementing quantum computing, and what potential solutions exist?"**: This question is clear, focused (on quantum computing), complex (requires understanding of quantum computing principles and challenges), and arguable (different solutions can be proposed and evaluated).

5. **"How can artificial intelligence be integrated into healthcare to improve patient outcomes?"**: This question is clear, focused (on AI in healthcare), complex (requires understanding of AI and healthcare systems), and arguable (the impact of AI on patient outcomes can be debated).

PS:  What do you think is the most challenging aspect of crafting a research question?
