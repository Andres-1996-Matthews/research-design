## About Me
Hello. My name is **Alexander Tan Ka Jin**. I am 21 years old and am a fresh graduate of University of Nottingham. My previous degree is a Bachelor on Mathematical Sciences and Data Science. I'm from Malaysia. I was born in Malaysia on 2003 and I have been living here with my parents since then.

I picked up data science for my higher studies due to the wide range of applications it has on the contemporary world and the wide set of skills I could potentially develop for myself. I am currently studying a **Masters** that is a continuation of my Bachelors

The world is now very much dependent on the manipulation of data and information and I wish to develop those skills to better navigate the contemporary world.

## Skills
I have been programming since young. Since I wanted to create a game on Roblox. I didn't create one but I am still trying to on engines more capable of making video games in my spare time.

Languages I know:
- Lua
- C
- C#
- Java
- Python
- R
- Haskell

Video game engines I have used were: **Unity** and **Godot**

The main language I am most proficient at is Python after my bachelors where extensive use of **Python** was needed for Data Science.
In addition I have developed a skill for typing in **LaTeX** through my undergraduate studies
