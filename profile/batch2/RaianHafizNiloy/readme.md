## About Me
Hello! I am Raian. I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Data Science at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). 

With a strong foundation in engineering principles, I am passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems and drive informed decision-making. My academic journey has equipped me with a comprehensive skill set allowing me to approach challenges from a multidisciplinary perspective.

During my undergraduate thesis, I developed a keen interest in how data can transform industries and improve efficiencies. This led me to pursue a Master's in Data Science, where I am eyeing to skill up myself in dat analysis, advanced data modeling, machine learning and data visualization.

Beyond academics, I have participated in various projects and competitions that have honed my practical skills and teamwork abilities. I am excited to apply my knowledge to real-world scenarios, contributing to innovative solutions and continuous learning in the rapidly evolving field of data science.
