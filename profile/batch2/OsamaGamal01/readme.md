## 🚀 About Me

A highly motivated **Electrical Engineer** with a fresh degree from the **Faculty of Electrical Engineering at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)**. With a solid foundation in **automation**, **embedded systems**, and **renewable energy**, I am driven by a passion for applying technology to solve real-world problems. I love combining **hardware** and **software** to build smarter systems and innovate in exciting fields like **IoT** and **automation**.

🔋 I'm fascinated by how we can use technology to **reduce energy consumption**, create **intelligent systems**, and contribute to a more **sustainable world**.

Currently, I’m pursuing my **Master's in Data Science**, where I’m expanding my skills to include **machine learning**, and **data analytics**. This has opened up new avenues for me to combine my engineering background with data science to create even more efficient, data-driven solutions. My goal is to merge the physical and digital worlds by applying data science to engineering problems, building systems that are not only smarter but also more sustainable.
