# Chapter 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)/Initial Results
## 4.1 introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a key part of understanding the data about Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). It helps us discover important patterns and relationships in the data. In this section, we will use simple statistics and visual tools like charts and graphs to get a clear picture of the dataset. These tools will help us spot trends, find any unusual data points, and see how different factors might be connected to PCOS.

By analyzing these relationships, we can identify which factors are most important for predicting and understanding PCOS. This analysis sets the stage for building accurate models that can help healthcare professionals diagnose and manage PCOS more effectively. Overall, EDA is a crucial step that helps us make sense of the complex data and informs our approach to improving PCOS research and treatment

Examining a correlation matrix of all the features by using a heatmap to see the pattern illustrated the correlation between feature 
For the PCOS dataset, at the right of the figure, we can see there is a high correlation between weight gain, hair growth (in undesire spots), skin darkening, hair loss, pimples, and fast food, at the right of figure, at the middle we can see there is a correlation between hip, waist size, and waist-hip ratio when wais size increase the hip size increase also.
