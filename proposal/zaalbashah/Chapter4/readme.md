# Chapter 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)/Initial Results
## 4.1 introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a key part of understanding the data about Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). It helps us discover important patterns and relationships in the data. In this section, we will use simple statistics and visual tools like charts and graphs to get a clear picture of the dataset. These tools will help us spot trends, find any unusual data points, and see how different factors might be connected to PCOS.

By analyzing these relationships, we can identify which factors are most important for predicting and understanding PCOS. This analysis sets the stage for building accurate models that can help healthcare professionals diagnose and manage PCOS more effectively. Overall, EDA is a crucial step that helps us make sense of the complex data and informs our approach to improving PCOS research and treatment
