1.1 Introduction

Overview of Sentiment Analysis in Financial Contexts
- Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the computational study of people's opinions, sentiments, attitudes, and emotions expressed in written language. It is a crucial tool in natural language processing and text mining, particularly for analyzing subjective information in texts such as news articles.

Application of Sentiment Analysis in Financial News
- Financial news headlines contain valuable information that can influence stock market movements. By analyzing the sentiment of these headlines, stakeholders can gain insights into market trends and make informed decisions. This approach has been applied in various studies to predict stock market behavior based on the sentiment extracted from news articles.

Sentiment Analysis Techniques and Algorithms
- Various machine learning algorithms and lexicon-based approaches have been employed for sentiment analysis in financial contexts. For instance, the Opinion Lexicon-based algorithm and Naive Bayes algorithm have been used to analyze the sentiment of financial news headlines in Malaysia. These methods involve several pre-processing steps such as data extraction, stop word removal, and stemming to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Impact of News Sentiment on Stock Prices
- Studies have shown that news sentiment can significantly impact stock prices. For example, sentiment analysis of dividend news and company announcements has been used to guide traders in making better decisions during the dividend period. However, the effect of news sentiment on stock prices can vary, with some studies indicating minimal impact within a normal range of daily price movement.

Predictive Models and Accuracy
- Advanced predictive models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have been utilized to enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions by incorporating news sentiment data. These models have demonstrated improved performance compared to traditional algorithms like decision trees, particularly when applied to datasets from stock exchanges such as Bursa Malaysia.

Correlation Between Sentiment and Stock Market Movement
- Research has indicated a correlation between the sentiment of financial news and stock market movements. For instance, a study on Genting Berhad's stock prices showed a significant correlation between historical stock prices and sentiment data, highlighting the potential of sentiment analysis in predicting market trends.

Challenges and Future Directions
- Despite the promising results, challenges remain in improving the accuracy of sentiment analysis models and their application to stock price prediction. Future research could focus on refining these models and exploring their applicability to other financial markets and instruments.
