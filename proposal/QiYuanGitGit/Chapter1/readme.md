## 1.2 	Research Background
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of identifying individuals' opinions, emotions, attitudes, and feelings expressed in written form, specifically in financial news (Mishra, 2023; Shuhidan et al., 2018). This analysis is essential for predicting market trends in financial environments. Stakeholders can utilize sentiment analysis of news headlines to obtain valuable insights to inform their decision-making processes. Different strategies, like lexicon-based approaches and algorithms such as Naive Bayes, are commonly used in sentiment analysis(Cheng Kuan et al., 2019).
Research has shown that the mood portrayed in news articles can greatly influence the value of stocks, with technologies like long short-term memory (LSTM) networks presenting an opportunity to improve the precision of stock price predictions (Sidek et al., 2023). In Malaysia, the assessment of feelings in news headlines has been studied using machine learning techniques such as Hybrid Naive Bayes, Opinion Lexicon-based algorithm, and Naive Bayes (Cheng Kuan et al., 2019; Shuhidan et al., 2018).
The emotions conveyed in financial news appear to have a strong link with the movement of the stock market. This suggests that sentiment analysis could be an effective approach for predicting market patterns (McCarthy & Alaghband, 2023). Even with these improvements, difficulties remain in improving the precision of sentiment analysis models. In this research, our goal is to explore the sentiment analysis of news headlines and how it influences stock price changes in the Malaysian market. By filling the gaps in current literature and investigating new methods, we aim to contribute to the progress of sentiment analysis in financial environments.

## 1.3 	Statement of the Problem
It is crucial to grasp the sentiment in financial news headlines in order to predict stock market movements accurately, as these headlines hold vital information that can greatly impact stock prices. Different methods of sentiment analysis, including the Opinion Lexicon-based algorithm and Naive Bayes, have been utilized to evaluate sentiment in financial news. Nevertheless, obstacles remain in accurately predicting stock prices, particularly in relation to public attitudes and the distinct features of Malaysian online news platforms. While past studies have indicated a link between news sentiment and stock market fluctuations, the impact of sentiment on stock prices could vary. Advanced predictive models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, guarantee the improvement of stock price predictions by incorporating sentiment data. These models provide an advanced method for examining emotions and how they influence market patterns.
Future studies can concentrate on improving these sophisticated predictive models to increase their precision in forecasting stock prices. Furthermore, investigating how these models can be applied to various financial markets can offer valuable insights for enhancing the overall precision of predicting stock prices. Researchers can improve predictive models, resolve challenges, and improve tools to forecast the stock market trends using sentiment analysis in financial news. Financial news headlines have a significant impact on stock market movements, but the exact effect of these sentiments on stock prices in Malaysia is not fully comprehended. Effectively predicting stock prices is challenging due to the need to combine historical data analysis with public sentiment analysis, making it difficult to improve accuracy through sentiment analysis integration. Existing studies provide a visualization regarding how the news sentiment influences the stock prices, and emphasize the necessity of advanced predictive models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to elevate prediction precision.
Although there is a known correlation between financial news sentiment and stock market movements, there is still limited research focused on Malaysia. Therefore, there is a need for further investigations into how news sentiment affects stock prices in the Malaysian financial market. Despite encouraging findings, persistent challenges exist in fine-tuning sentiment analysis models for optimal stock price prediction accuracy. The difficulty and complexity to accurate predict the stock prices in the Malaysian market involves a blend of historical data analysis and the integration of public sentiment. This poses the challenges to effectively incorporating the sentiment analysis to enhance prediction accuracy. This research aims to explore the impact of sentiment expressed in financial news headlines on stock price movements in the Malaysian market, evaluating traditional sentiment analysis techniques and advanced predictive models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to improve the precision of stock price forecasts within the Malaysian financial landscape.
