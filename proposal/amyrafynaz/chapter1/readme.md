### Prepared by: NURAMIRA SHAFINAZ BINTI ZULAILEE, MCS231031

## 1.0 Introduction
In the modern world, the efficient management and planning of energy resources are pivotal for ensuring economic stability and sustainable development. Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for rapidly developing countries like Malaysia to address the growing demand and make informed decisions regarding energy production, distribution, and policymaking. As Malaysia continues its journey towards industrialization and urbanization, understanding and predicting energy consumption patterns becomes increasingly complex and vital.

Malaysia's energy landscape has undergone significant changes over the past few decades. The country's energy sector, characterized by a diverse mix of fossil fuels (natural gas, coal, and oil) and renewable energy sources (hydropower, solar, and biomass), has seen substantial growth in demand due to industrial expansion, urban development, and population growth. This rising energy demand presents opportunities and challenges for Malaysia, necessitating sophisticated forecasting methods to ensure energy security, economic efficiency, and environmental sustainability.

Time series forecasting is a well-established method for predicting future values based on historical data. It involves analysing past energy consumption patterns to identify trends, seasonality, and other temporal dynamics. Regression techniques, in particular, are powerful tools in time series forecasting as they model the relationship between energy consumption (the dependent variable) and various influencing factors (independent variables) such as GDP, population, and temperature.


## 1.1 Background of the Problem
There are important issues that are also valid and deserve to be highlighted when forecasting energy consumption in Malaysia. Since it is affected, for instance, by economic growth, technological innovation, variation in climate conditions, and changes in policies concerning consumer behaviour, it occasionally becomes difficult to forecast it accurately. Also, gaps, inconsistencies, and delays in reporting significantly decrease the quality and timeliness of the data utilized in forecasting. Furthermore, the change in the pattern of using energy-efficient appliances, progress in the higher technologies used in energy grids, and continual development of grid technology also contribute to the problems that make it challenging to obtain a high level of accuracy in the forecast. Consumer decisions are affected by other policy and regulatory changes regarding subsidies, tariffs, and incentives concerning renewable energy.

## 1.2 Statement of the Problem
Malaysia has been experiencing a rapid rate of economic growth. Thus, coupled with development, it has contributed to the increased use of energy through industrialization, the expansion of urban centres, and the growth of the population base. This increasing energy demand is vital in providing secure, efficient, and sustainable energy systems. Moreover, traditional approaches in forecasting do not capture consumption well mainly because energy consumption is often impacted by several factors, including economic indicators, technological development, and variations in climate, among others; alongside, there are often breaks in data, inaccurate data and delays in reporting data progress making it challenging to come up with accurate forecast data.

Having adequate and precise energy consumption forecasts is vital to enable Malaysia to manage its energy demands and formulate policies. It will enable policymakers and energy planners to make appropriate decisions regarding energy supplies, distribution and generation investments. With inaccurate forecasting, there might be a lead of energy deficit or excesses, wastage of resources, and failure to attain a new paradigm concerning renewable energy and viable environmental footprints.
This study proposes using advanced regression techniques for time series forecasting to improve the accuracy of energy consumption predictions in Malaysia. Compared to other methods, regression analysis can embrace all the qualities and interconnections within the energy consumption data and the factors affecting it, thus providing more accurate predictions. The findings from this study will help policymakers and energy planners formulate policies that accommodate Malaysia's energy demands through a well-informed analysis of the various energy priorities that can contribute to the balanced energy mix in the country.

## 1.5 Scope of the Study
In forecasting energy consumption in Malaysia, this study employs regression techniques with several essential aspects to ensure a comprehensive approach. Therefore, the empirical coverage of the research is nationwide, involving states and regions in the country, both urban and rural, hence offering a consolidated view of energy consumption. The time frame includes historical energy consumption data for several decades to capture long-term trends, seasonality, and potential cyclical patterns, as well as data projections for the near future (up to 5-10 years) valid in short and medium-term energy planning.

Data will be sourced from reputable national and international databases, including the Energy Commission of Malaysia, the Department of Statistics Malaysia, Tenaga National Berhad, the Climate Change Knowledge Portal and global organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Bank. The study will incorporate various types of data, such as total energy consumption, sector-specific consumption, economic indicators (GDP), consumer price index (CPI), demographic data (population growth), and climatic variables (temperature, humidity).

Methodologically, in this study, different types of regression analysis, such as linear regression, polynomial regression, and multiple linear regression, will be applied. Data pre-processing will involve data cleansing, transformation, and feature engineering to fit the data set into the model. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will uncover hidden structures and relationships in the dataset to be analysed. Model evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) will be used, and cross-validation techniques will be employed to ensure the models’ reliability and applicability are tested.

The study will also compare and determine the extent of contributions from specific economic, demographic and climatic variables on energy consumption. Scenario analysis will clarify how changes in economic and environmental conditions in the future can impact energy consumption and what impact policy changes regarding energy efficiency measures and the promotion of renewable energy can have.

The insight will help inform policymakers and assist the planning process for energy needs in Malaysia by making recommendations that will secure energy availability, be economically rational from a global perspective, and respect environmental limits. The study will also state significant limitations, including data availability and quality and unpredictable future energy patterns.
