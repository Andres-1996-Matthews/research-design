### Project Title: Time Series Forecasting for Energy Consumption in Malaysia Using Regression Technique

### Prepared by: NURAMIRA SHAFINAZ BINTI ZULAILEE, MCS231031

## 1.0 Introduction
In the modern world, the efficient management and planning of energy resources are pivotal for ensuring economic stability and sustainable development. Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for rapidly developing countries like Malaysia to address the growing demand and make informed decisions regarding energy production, distribution, and policymaking. As Malaysia continues its journey towards industrialization and urbanization, understanding and predicting energy consumption patterns becomes increasingly complex and vital.

Malaysia's energy landscape has undergone significant changes over the past few decades. The country's energy sector, characterized by a diverse mix of fossil fuels (natural gas, coal, and oil) and renewable energy sources (hydropower, solar, and biomass), has seen substantial growth in demand due to industrial expansion, urban development, and population growth. This rising energy demand presents opportunities and challenges for Malaysia, necessitating sophisticated forecasting methods to ensure energy security, economic efficiency, and environmental sustainability.

Time series forecasting is a well-established method for predicting future values based on historical data. It involves analysing past energy consumption patterns to identify trends, seasonality, and other temporal dynamics. Regression techniques, in particular, are powerful tools in time series forecasting as they model the relationship between energy consumption (the dependent variable) and various influencing factors (independent variables) such as GDP, population, and temperature.
