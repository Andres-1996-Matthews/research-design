## INTRODUCTION 

Tourism is one of the contributing factors for Malaysia’s economic growth before pandemic COVID-19 in 2020 and now is slowly rebounding post pandemic. Based on the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture Malaysia (MOTAC), in 2018, the total number of tourist arrivals in Malaysia reached 25.83 million people and has increased to 26.1 million in 2019. As the pandemic COVID19 hits worldwide and most of the countries close their borders, Malaysia faces a major decline in the number of tourists in 2020 and 2021. However, the tourism industry started to gain tourists in 2022 as Malaysia opened their international borders, and continues to increase from 10.07 million people in 2022 to 14.47 million people visiting Malaysia in 2023. 

Tourist visits are heavily influenced by global travellers' satisfaction, reviews and feedback. There is an immediate need for improvement in the tourism business through the analysis of travellers' experiences. In order to draw travellers' internal motivations, major attractions should be provided as appropriate pull factors [1]. Tourism managers should enhance their services and implement marketing strategies to better meet the factors that influence travellers' desire to visit the destinations [2].

As technology becomes more advanced over the years, with more social media platforms and review websites being provided to the public, people are using them to express their opinions and experiences about various products, services and travel destinations. This is called user-generated content (UGC) and in the context of the tourism industry, it enables travellers to share their reviews and feedback on travel-related websites [3]. Travellers usually rely on UGC shared by other travellers worldwide to take their advice or recommendations before planning their trips to certain destinations where they are not familiar with. Tourism destinations are being forced to adopt new strategies for drawing visitors in order to remain competitive due to the increased competition among tourism destinations as well as changes in the expectations and habits of tourists [4]. UGC became a data source to analyse travellers perceptions on tourist destinations. Travellers' opinions and feedback are collected through the mining of online text information and the use of sentiment analysis techniques to identify positive or negative emotions expressed in the text. This information is then used to improve the quality of the destination and ensure a balance between social, economic, and environmental issues as well as the achievement of sustainable development [5]. 

Sentiment analysis provides the ability to identify the sentiments underlying reviews and classify them accordingly. [6]. Existing sentiment analysis methods in various domains use machine learning algorithms such as Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), maximum entropy classifier (Max. Ent.), random forest (RF) and Decision Tree (J48) [7,8]. Deep learning approaches have been more popular in recent years due to their ability to increase the accuracy of data classification, especially when thousands of examples of labelled data are present. [9]. This research focuses on analysing online travel reviews from TripAdvisor and Google Map review websites using deep learning techniques to investigate the travellers’ perceptions on Langkawi, Kedah post-COVID19 and factors that influence the positive and negative feelings.

## PROBLEM BACKGROUND

Travellers reviews and feedback have influence on travellers’ behaviour and perceptions, hence it is crucial for the tourism industry to improve services in order to attract more global tourists and meet their changing expectations. Text reviews on the internet are analysed using sentiment analysis techniques to find positive and negative feelings that passengers have expressed. Deep learning techniques have become more and more popular because of their ability to understand the context of documents and increased accuracy in data classification. The goal of this study is to better comprehend tourists' opinions on Langkawi, Kedah, by conducting topic-based analysis on traveller reviews through the use of deep learning techniques.

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS

What are the key topics from user reviews on the tourism industry in Langkawi, Kedah?
How do LSTM and BERT models perform in sentiment analysis when applied to identified topics from user reviews on Langkawi, Kedah?
What are the performance of different deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis?

## OBJECTIVES
1. To determine the key topics from user reviews on the tourism industry in Langkawi, Kedah.
2. To develop the LSTM algorithm and fine-tune BERT for sentiment analysis on chosen topics. 
3. To evaluate the performance of LSTM and BERT in sentiment analysis.

## SCOPE OF THE STUDY

The goal of this research is to analyse online reviews in Langkawi, Kedah using deep learning techniques. This research's scope is as follows:

Online review sentiment analysis specifically in Langkawi, Kedah.
Web scraping from TripAdvisor and Google Map website limited to English language.
Employing deep learning methods for sentiment analysis to classify travellers sentiments.
Performance evaluation: Compare the performance of LSTM and BERT in sentiment analysis.

## ASSUMPTIONS

It is assumed that there is a significant volume of user feedback about the tourism industry in Langkawi, Kedah, that can be analysed. The reviews are assumed to reflect the general feelings of tourists visiting Langkawi, Kedah. It is anticipated that the sentiment labels used for training and evaluation (such as positive, negative, and neutral) are assigned correctly and consistently. The sentiment labels are assumed to accurately reflect the sentiment indicated in the user reviews.

## SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESEARCH

This project will provide valuable insights on the key topics and sentiment expressions from tourists travelling to Langkawi, Kedah post pandemic. This enables stakeholders, local tourism authorities, and businesses to get a better understanding of tourist experiences and preferences. By evaluating the performance of LSTM and BERT models in sentiment analysis, this research will add to the current body of knowledge about their strengths and shortcomings, directing future research and applications in the field.

## STRUCTURE OF THE THESIS
