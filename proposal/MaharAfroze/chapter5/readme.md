## Conclusion 
This chapter provides a brief summary of the project's major findings, offers finishing observations on its advantages and disadvantages, and presents recommendations for further research or improvements.


### 5.1 Summary of Key Findings
- **Identification of Prospective Students:** The research successfully developed a model to identify candidates interested in studying abroad, specifically at UTS College, who are currently undertaking or have just finished their A Levels and HSC English Version.

- **Social Media Insights:** Through an analysis of social media data, the project had the ability to determine demographic and engagement trends, which provided significant insights for targeted outreach.

- **Recruitment Funnel Analysis:** This study identified critical points in the recruitment process where potential students give up, highlighting areas that may be improved.

- **Predictive Model Performance:** Using significant qualities found throughout the feature engineering process, the predictive model efficiently assigned scores to potential students depending on how likely they were to enroll.

- **Dashboard Development:** The development of an interactive dashboard enables the recruitment team to select high-potential individuals, visualize trends, and make data-driven decisions.


### 5.2 Concluding Remarks on the Project's Success and Limitations
#### 5.2.1 Project Success:
- **Enhanced Recruitment Strategies:** By upgrading from manual, ad-driven methods to proactive identification and engagement, the initiative gave BERI a data-driven method to improve their recruitment strategy.

- **Improved Targeting:** Using the use of social media data, the effort made possible to target potential students more precisely, which increased conversion rates and made better use of available resources.

- **Comprehensive Dashboard:** The establishment of an extensive dashboard facilitated instantaneous analysis and insights, thus assisting the recruitment team in monitoring and adjusting their strategies.

#### 5.2.2 Project Limitations:
- **Data Quality and Availability:** The project experienced issues with the availability and quality of data, especially from social media sites, which may have affected the generalizability and accuracy of the model.

- **Model Bias:** The forecasting model's performance across a range of social media behaviors and demographics may be impacted by implicit prejudices obtained from the training data.

- **Scalability:** The dashboard and model were created with a particular use case ; hence, additional modifications and optimizations may be necessary to make them suitable for use with bigger datasets or in different settings.


### 5.3 Suggestions for Future Research or Improvements
- **Data Enrichment:** To increase the model's precision and depth of understanding, future studies may concentrate on enriching the dataset with data from other sources, such as academic transcripts or extracurricular activities.

- **Bias Mitigation:** Bias Mitigation Through implementing techniques in place to identify and minimize biases in the predictive model, we can improve its reliability and equity for a range of student demographics.

- **Advanced Analytics:** By investigating advanced analytics methods, such as textual data analysis from social media posts using natural language processing (NLP), more profound insights into the interests and behaviors of students may be gained.

- **Longitudinal Tracking:** Monitoring the success of the recruitment tactics over time through longitudinal research would yield insightful data for ongoing development and enhancement.

- **Scalability and Adaptability:** The project's applicability and impact can be increased by improving the model's and dashboard's scalability and adaptability to suit larger datasets or diverse educational situations.

- **User Feedback Integration:** Gathering input from potential students and the recruitment team can help continuously enhance the dashboard and model to better match user expectations.

Future research and developments may improve the efficacy and impact of data-driven recruitment methods by taking these recommendations into consideration. This will help BERI's projects and the field of educational data science as a whole succeed.
