## Chapter 1: Introduction
### 1.1 Introduction
The higher education sector in Malaysia has experienced significant expansion and development through the establishment and growth of many public and private institutions. The government's plan to make Malaysia a key player in higher education has led to substantial funding in infrastructure, faculty training, and academic offerings. The focus has been on enhancing both access to higher education and the quality of education to align with global benchmarks. The establishment of a variety of educational routes and specialized schools has met the needs of a broad spectrum of academic and career goals, demonstrating the ever-changing character of Malaysia's higher education environment.

Even with these progressions, issues with student grades and staying in school remain a significant worry. These challenges are crucial for both the academic progress of students and the larger objectives of national educational benchmarks and global competitiveness. High rates of students leaving school, extended times taken to complete studies, and variations in academic success between schools emphasize the necessity for a thorough comprehension of these problems. This proposal seeks to offer crucial insights into ongoing problems and create effective strategies for improvement by examining historical data from various institutions. This comprehensive strategy is crucial to guarantee that Malaysia's higher education system can effectively play its part in national progress and global competitiveness.

### 1.2 Problem Background
The performance and retention rates of students are crucial indicators of the success and quality of higher education institutions. In Malaysia, various factors such as academic readiness, socio-economic status, institutional assistance, and personal situations affect these measurements. Public and private institutions often encounter different obstacles, such as discrepancies in resource distribution, student populations, and institutional goals. Government-funded public institutions may face challenges due to limited resources and larger student-to-teacher ratios, which can impact the quality of education and support services for students.

On the other hand, private institutions, although usually having more resources, may face challenges like increased tuition costs and the need to ensure they remain financially stable, which could impact student recruitment and keeping students in the institution. Recent data shows that while some institutions have achieved notable progress in enhancing student outcomes, others still face challenges with high dropout rates, extended study times, and inconsistent academic results. This proposal seeks to explore these factors in order to identify the underlying reasons for these differences and suggest specific interventions that can be tailored to the specific circumstances of public and private institutions.

### 1.3 Problem Statement
The central issue this proposal seeks to address is the persistent challenge of suboptimal student performance and retention rates in Malaysian higher education institutions, encompassing both public and private sectors. Despite extensive efforts and resources dedicated to enhancing educational outcomes, many students fail to complete their studies within the expected timeframe or meet the academic standards required for graduation. This issue is multifaceted, involving academic, socio-economic, and personal dimensions that interact in complex ways. High attrition rates not only waste educational resources but also have significant socio-economic repercussions for the students and their families, potentially limiting future career opportunities and contributing to a cycle of underachievement.

This proposal aims to tackle the ongoing problem of lower-than-desired student achievement and retention rates in Malaysian higher education institutions, including both public and private sectors. Despite the substantial amount of time and money invested in improving educational results, numerous students do not finish their studies on time or achieve the necessary academic benchmarks for graduating. This problem has many different aspects, which include academic, socio-economic, and personal dimensions that are interconnected in intricate ways. High levels of student turnover not only lead to the inefficient use of educational resources but also result in important socio-economic consequences for the students and their families, which may restrict their future prospects and perpetuate a pattern of poor performance.

### 1.4 Objectives
This proposal has many different objectives, seeking to analyze thoroughly and provide effective solutions to enhance student performance and retention in Malaysian higher education institutions:

### To Analyze Past Data:
Perform an in-depth analysis of past student achievement and retention records from public and private schools to discover patterns, trends, and root causes. This study will use statistical methods to ensure a thorough comprehension of the data and its ramifications.
### To Identify Key Factors:
Identify the main academic, socio-economic, and institutional factors that have a significant influence on student performance and retention rates. This will require both qualitative and quantitative evaluations to offer a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting student results.
### To Develop a Monitoring Framework: 
Develop a structure for ongoing monitoring and assessment of student results to guarantee the lasting impact and success of the suggested initiatives. This structure will consist of essential performance metrics and routine evaluation procedures.

### 1.5 Gap Analysis
Despite the abundance of research on student performance and retention in Malaysia's dual-sector higher education system, there is still a substantial gap in fully understanding these issues. A large portion of current research tends to concentrate solely on public or private institutions, without taking into account an integrated perspective that includes data and insights from both types. Furthermore, the lack of long-term studies observing changes over extended periods hinders the comprehension of long-term trends and impacts. It is crucial to conduct a comprehensive evaluation that considers both public and private organizations, as well as the interactions among different elements over a period of time, in order to create successful tactics.

This proposal seeks to address these disparities by using a comprehensive dataset collected over several years from a variety of public and private sources. This method will offer a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the obstacles encountered and the elements that impact students' achievements or setbacks. This study will provide a thorough analysis by combining both quantitative and qualitative data to guide specific and lasting actions. This thorough examination will also assist in pinpointing effective tactics and methods that can be expanded and adjusted within various institutions.

### 1.6 Scope
This proposal includes a thorough investigation of student achievement and retention in public and private universities in Malaysia. Analyzing data from previous years is necessary to discover trends and key elements that impact student results.  This analysis will cover a range of elements including academic performance metrics, socio-economic influences and institutional support structures. The research seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing student results by utilizing a variety of data sources and analytical methods.

Rather than engaging with stakeholders directly, the proposal will depend on a thorough examination of current literature and institutional reports. This method ensures that the research is influenced by a diverse range of viewpoints and experiences found in previous research. Furthermore, comparing performance with best practices of top international higher education institutions will offer valuable insights. The final aim is to offer thorough, research-supported suggestions to help educational leaders and institutional stakeholders in adopting successful tactics to enhance student performance and retention rates. The results and suggestions will be customized to tackle the distinct obstacles and possibilities in Malaysia's higher education sector, guaranteeing that the actions taken are pertinent and effective.

Through the implementation of this thorough and evidence-based strategy, the proposal aims to make a significant impact on the improvement of Malaysia's higher education system, ultimately aligning with the country's overarching educational and economic goals. This method will guarantee that Malaysia can reach its objective of becoming a premier educational center in the region, creating a space where students can excel academically and personally.
