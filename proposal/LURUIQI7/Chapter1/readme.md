## 1.1 Introduction
Introduction Traffic congestion is a worldwide problem resulting in many urban and regional areas, including Malaysia. Bringing shoulder to shoulder with an insufficient number of road users, vehicle congestion and ineffective traffic control, can cause less delays, higher fuel spending, rising air pollution, and reduced commercial efficiency. Evidently, the challenges require good understanding of the traffic problem and end line congestion. The congestion in traffic congestion is quite clear in urban areas such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and Johor Bahru. This periodic traffic jam is a problem not limited to urban areas, but also from cities to rural areas. Such as geographical a map, each location has its own population and other traffic congestion problems. Observation and signal management approaches and design should be tailored to local conditions and patterns. This indicator includes a series of traders whose cars are delayed and the level of road congestion is estimated. As the congestion indicator is the future of road congestion, the use of napolis will be more abundant than the road, the greater the traffic within the road. Transportation improvement and vehicle safety driving, infrastructure and other drivers have expressed great attention to traffic jam in the region. This paper will be the line of the station to predict regional highways in Malaysia. Use all kinds of traffic grading software to actually get off on a different topic.

Furthermore, the model may be implemented in a state-level analysis to identify traffic trends and AKIs that contribute to congestion in different states across the country. Specifically, an analytical comparison of major traffic patterns across states will be performed. Lastly, the study will propose key recommendations based on the prediction of the mathematical modeling as well as insight from the first and second analysis that may be effectively implemented for traffic management purposes. By contributing data-driven methods to alleviate traffic congestion in cities, this research aims to impact national or regional transportation policies on a significant scale. The potential improvements in traffic flow can create better commutes, a more environmentally friendly way to travel, and encourages economic growth. The study is impactful at a scale as it provides first-tier data and algorithmic output to city and state traffic planning department, where real-world problems require efficient and practical segregation from data driving devices. 

## 1.2 Problem Background
Malaysia is an archipelago situated in Southeast Asia that has seen its cities and economy urbanize quite rapidly in the past decade. Growing with major cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and Johor Bahru, Malaysia is also home to a very large number of traveling population 2 , and the number of vehicles on the road has increased at a rate higher than the number of vehicles. Such data on the usage of the road is a significant contributor to the current state of traffic congestion in Malaysia. The impact of congestion extends over all major socioeconomic metrics, predicts higher consumption of time and fuel by commuters, lower rate of economic productivity, and even an increase in air pollution attributed to acrid fuel burn and waste. In Malaysia there are a vast majority of hotspots that are the cause of congestion. The vast number of jurisdictions is of an entirely different geocentric location, and with often a rural village at the distance, there can be an extremely difference in the ability of the jurisdiction to invest in its roads and people. The management of traffic congestion in Malaysia has historically been managed by large capital capital spending, some of which are the new roads, new crossings, and converting existing thoroughfares to rural highways. However, not only is this approach one of the least productive during fiscal periods, there can be disparity in the way money is spent, some often spotting the expressway speedway should be two-lane. In a time where money and efficiency are the goal of a great society, the scientific data science approach can come to addinventively in the planning and management of traffic congestion in cities and states of Malaysia. 

## 1.3 Problem Statement
Traffic congestion is a wide-range problem that is influenced by many factors such as traffic volume, road conditions, weather, public events among othersAnalyzing and attacking the problem is a complex task. Traditional methods of attacking the problem have fallen short in the hope of managing traffic volume and giving a cleaner experience to the commuter. 

## 1.4 Research Questions
1. What are the major contributors that cause traffic congestion across different parts of Malaysia? 
2. How can we model these factors using predictive models that can forecast traffic congestion levels? 
3. How do the traffic patterns and congestion factors that contribute to traffic conditions vary for different regions within Malaysia? 
4. What actionable insights and recommendations can be made based on the analysis and model predictions to effectively control and manage traffic congestion? 

## 1.5 Objectives of the Research
1. Data Collection Publicly available data on a number of factors will be collected. These factors will include traffic, weather, roadworks, and public events in different parts of Malaysia. 
2. Feature Engineering Based on the data of the above-discussed factors, some features or attributes will be used to build computational models or predictors of the traffic congestion level at different parts of Malaysia. 
3. Model Establishment A few computational models will be established to predict the traffic congestion level. Some statistical and computational measures will be used to check the accuracy of these models. 
4. Regional Study With the help of the developed models, the possible traffic patterns in different states of Malaysia will be compared, and the states of Malaysia will be evaluated based on the magnitude of the cause of traffic congestion. 
5. Recommendations Based on the analysis, conclusions will be generated on which regions have the highest traffic congestion. In addition, suggestions to alleviate this congestion will be made. 

## 1.6 Scope of the Study
The scope includes: 
Geographical Coverage: The research will include locations of traffic flow present in urban centers, lesser cities as well as rural areas in different states. 
Data Sources: The data related to traffic reports, weather, roadworks, public events will be sourced from various open sources. Geo traffic datasets will be including Waze, Google Traffic, road info from Department of Public Works or any local government open data portals. 
Time Frame: The time period would be set for evaluating traffic data on daily, weekly, and monthly basis to see both short term immediate and long-term patterns. 
Analytical Techniques: The methodology includes collection of data related to traffic, weather, and GIS modules/roadworks and through the application of machine learning algorithms to evaluate regional traffic patterns, traffic congestion started and to recommend routing choices particularly when there is severe congestion. 
Focus on Outcomes: The focus of attention will be identifying the main contributors of traffic congestion, to build correct and predictive models and to identify the actionable recommendations for traffic management authorities. 

## 1.7 Significance of the Research
This research has the potential to significantly benefit national and regional traffic management authorities in Malaysia by improving their understanding of the factors responsible for traffic congestion, and also by providing means of reducing this challenge. Further, this research can give a practical demonstration of application of data science techniques to solving a national-scale problem. 
Better Traffic Management 
Using machine learning algorithms, this research could offer the ability to predict traffic congestion accurately in real-time which would allow traffic management authorities to manage by proactively controlling traffic flow, reduce traffic congestion and improve transportation system efficiency. For instance, traffic signal timings would be dynamically adjusted using predictive models to adjust to changes in traffic flow, implement congestion pricing during peak hours or to optimize public transit schedules. A proactive approach can significantly reduce commuting time, fuel consumption, and physical and economic well-being, thus contribute to a sustainable urban environment. 
Data-driven Decision Making 
The findings of this research can help inform policy and decision-makers on how they plan to use quantitative information to make smarter decisions. Understanding of the factors leading to traffic congestion areas, such as high vehicle volume, road capacity and weather conditions, allows one to focus investment in areas with high congestion and prior measures such as closing roads during peak hours of congestion and improving public transit in high congestion areas. Data-driven decision-making means that limited resources can be spent in more productive ways, reducing traffic congestion. 
Economic Impact 
Traffic congestion is usually costly, affecting the economy through lost productivity, higher fuel consumption and increased vehicle maintenance. Traffic congestion reduction as a result of this research could lead to lower operating costs from improved traffic flow to the transportation of goods, shorter delivery times for businesses, and a reduction in the overall cost of goods. Furthermore, a significant improvement in the transportation system induces more capital investments, which in turn drives economic growth by enhancing accessibility and connectivity within urban areas. 
Environmental Impact 
By reducing the traffic congestion, we will reduce the emission of pollutants in the environment, thereby reducing the effects of global warming and reduce environmental pollution. The solution to the problem of traffic will reduce the likelihood of cars passing through congested areas with the engine running and unnecessary gear changes, which means less fuel consumption with reduced gas emissions that create air pollution. Our strategy to predict and overcome congestion through intelligent and autonomous transport systems will lead to a cleaner, healthier world. Our study aligns with the global effort to mitigate climate change and is part of the process of reducing the carbon footprint. 
Social Benefits 
Traffic congestion directly affects the living standards of urban residents particularly in terms of quality of life and time utilization due to the fact that they are stuck in traffic for an infinite time. This will enable citizens to work more effectively as it will reduce the time people waste on the road while fleeing traffic jams and allow them to work longer on less congested roads. Reducing the number of traffic accidents caused by traffic is also a very important social benefit and will provide a safer transport environment. 
Demonstration of Data Science Applications 
Our study will also demonstrate the applicability of data analytics and machine learning in solving real-world urban problems. By applying advanced analytical techniques to address the complex urban problems, this study will demonstrate the tangible benefits of data-driven approaches in urban transportation planning and management. This will serve as a reference and reference for other cities and regions with similar problems in the use of big data in solving problems in urban planning and management. Through training and overcoming traffic jams, our work can be used in various regions and cities, which can stimulate the wider use of big data in the formulation and implementation of urban policies and solutions. Moreover, our study also contributes to the academic and professional discourse on the role of machine learning in transportation. This research will provide valuable models and insights for future research.
