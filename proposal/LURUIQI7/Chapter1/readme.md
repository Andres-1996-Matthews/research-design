## Abstract 

Traffic congestion is a common concern in Malaysia, especially in urban and rural areas. It hinders mobility, affects residents' commute time, reduces economic efficiency, and negatively impacts the quality of life. This research aims to predict traffic congestion in Malaysia by region, using different publicly available data sources. The utilization of data science methods to explore patterns of traffic congestion raises awareness on the causes of traffic congestion and contributes to national and regional traffic management and urban planning efforts. This research directs recommended traffic flow improvements and congestion reduction in traffic so as to increase the operational efficiency as well as commuter satisfaction. 

# Chapter 1: Introduction 

## 1.1 Introduction 

Traffic congestion is a worldwide problem resulting in many urban and regional areas, including Malaysia. Bringing shoulder to shoulder with an insufficient number of road users, vehicle congestion and ineffective traffic control, can cause less delays, higher fuel spending, rising air pollution, and reduced commercial efficiency. Evidently, the challenges require good understanding of the traffic problem and end line congestion. The congestion in traffic congestion is quite clear in urban areas such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and Johor Bahru. This periodic traffic jam is a problem not limited to urban areas, but also from cities to rural areas. Such as geographical a map, each location has its own population and other traffic congestion problems. Observation and signal management approaches and design should be tailored to local conditions and patterns. This indicator includes a series of traders whose cars are delayed and the level of road congestion is estimated. As the congestion indicator is the future of road congestion, the use of napolis will be more abundant than the road, the greater the traffic within the road. Transportation improvement and vehicle safety driving, infrastructure and other drivers have expressed great attention to traffic jam in the region. This paper will be the line of the station to predict regional highways in Malaysia. Use all kinds of traffic grading software to actually get off on a different topic.

Furthermore, the model may be implemented in a state-level analysis to identify traffic trends and AKIs that contribute to congestion in different states across the country. Specifically, an analytical comparison of major traffic patterns across states will be performed. Lastly, the study will propose key recommendations based on the prediction of the mathematical modeling as well as insight from the first and second analysis that may be effectively implemented for traffic management purposes. By contributing data-driven methods to alleviate traffic congestion in cities, this research aims to impact national or regional transportation policies on a significant scale. The potential improvements in traffic flow can create better commutes, a more environmentally friendly way to travel, and encourages economic growth. The study is impactful at a scale as it provides first-tier data and algorithmic output to city and state traffic planning department, where real-world problems require efficient and practical segregation from data driving devices. 

## 1.2 Problem Background 

Malaysia is located in Southeast Asia that has seen its cities and economy urbanize quite rapidly in the past decade. Growing with major cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and Johor Bahru, Malaysia is also home to a very large number of traveling population, and the number of vehicles on the road has increased at a rate higher than the number of vehicles. Such data on the usage of the road is a significant contributor to the current state of traffic congestion in Malaysia. The impact of congestion extends over all major socioeconomic metrics, predicts higher consumption of time and fuel by commuters, lower rate of economic productivity, and even an increase in air pollution attributed to acrid fuel burn and waste. In Malaysia there are a vast majority of hotspots that are the cause of congestion. The vast number of jurisdictions is of an entirely different geocentric location, and with often a rural village at the distance, there can be an extremely difference in the ability of the jurisdiction to invest in its roads and people. The management of traffic congestion in Malaysia has historically been managed by large capital capital spending, some of which are the new roads, new crossings, and converting existing thoroughfares to rural highways. However, not only is this approach one of the least productive during fiscal periods, there can be disparity in the way money is spent, some often spotting the expressway speedway should be two-lane. In a time where money and efficiency are the goal of a great society, the scientific data science approach can come to addinventively in the planning and management of traffic congestion in cities and states of Malaysia. 

## 1.3 Problem Statement 

Traffic congestion is a widespread issue influenced by various factors such as traffic volume, road conditions, weather, and public events. Analyzing and addressing this problem is complex. Traditional methods of managing traffic have often failed to effectively control traffic volume and provide a smoother experience for commuters.

Traffic, weather, and GIS modules/roadworks data will be collected and then specific machine learning algorithm would be applied to get regionally traffic patterns, identifying the traffic congestion started and recommending route choices when there is severe traffic congestion. 

### 1.6.5. Focus on Outcome: 

The prime focus is to recognize the cause of major traffic congestion and then establish the right predictive special models for traffic congestion. The aim is to provide actionable recommendations to traffic management authorities with the help of analytical data to support. 

## 1.7 Significance 

This research has the ability to make a considerable contribution to national and regional traffic authorities in Malaysia, by providing them a better understanding of what drives traffic congestion, and how to create strategies to mitigate this challenge. Moreover, it will provide a live demonstration how data science methodologies can be useful in the solution of a national scale problem. 

### Improve Traffic Management: 

This research can help in creating machine learning algorithm that could be used to predict traffic congestion reliably in real-time. That will help traffic management bodies to proactively manage traffic flow to avoid traffic congestion and increase the transportation system. For example, traffic signal timing could be adjusted using predictive models that were agents of change relative to the predicted flow volume. On average, the congestion price or public transit timetables will be improved during rush hours. A proactive approach to using such information can greatly reduce commute times and reduce fuel consumption, while preserving the safety and well-being of people and property values, and thus contribute to creating a sustainable urban environment. 

### Data-Driven Decision Making 

The results of this study can be useful for informing policymakers and decision makers in how to achieve better solutions using quantitative data. Knowledge of the factors that contribute to the formation of congestion, such as vehicle traffic, the capacity of the road, and local weather, can help. Previous installation of traffic control measures, in areas of congestion, involves tactics such as road closure at the peak time of flooding, and public transit improvements in the areas of congestion. Making decisions through data provides a case where limited resources are used more wisely, leading to a reduction in congestion. 

### Economic Impact 

Congestion in traffic congestion is usually costly and has a number of influences on the economy, including lost production, higher fuel use, and increased vehicle repair has West global warming. Imagine that this study aims to reduce the time of movement to destruction. The slowing of the exchange of goods reduces operating costs means of service delivery and, on the other hand, will reduce the cargo delivery cost. Moreover, the very considerable change in the transportation system can show a strong trend towards the improvement of infrastructure, and the saving of transportation allows the economic world to remain optimistic and emotional. permanent value of cars. The economic change is based on a multifunctional system. Even small lines can have a very dramatic effect on creating additional accessibility and harmony in the city. 

### Environmental Impact 

By reducing traffic congestion, we also reduce the amount of pollution released into the environment, and as such reduce the short term and long term effects of pollutants release into the environment, and as such reduce the amount of pollutants released into the environment and reduce the harmful effects of pollutants. The solution to the traffic problem means smaller emissions of hydrocarbons geological gases (CO 2 ). Reducing the amount of traffic jam leaves fuel behind the engine that would otherwise have created an air pollutant. Our strategy to predicting, and mitigating congestion through advanced intelligent and autonomous transport systems contribute to the greening of our environment, and the well-being of our citizens. Traffic congestion adversely impacts the quality of life of both urban citizens and freight movements, and this study will contribute to the global effort to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions from congestion. This is also contributing as a part of a larger movement to reduce carbon footprint. 

### Social Benefits 

Traffic congestion directly impacts the social welfare of urban citizens in terms of quality of life, wellbeing, and time utilization, that they spend forever in the traffic congestion. This result will allow citizens to be more productive providing them more time working for their living, and reducing time spent on roads escaping jams, and more time on roads when not jammed. It significantly reduces the number of traffic accidents caused by congestion and helps create a safer transport system. Data Science Applications This study will also demonstrate the role of data analytics and machine learning in addressing real-world urban problems. Providing solutions to complex conditions in urban environments requires sophisticated analytical methodologies that deliver value. By showing that there are tangible benefits to the application of data-driven approaches to urban transportation planning and management, this study will serve as a model and a guide to other cities and regions with similar challenges in the use of big data in solving urban planning and management issues. Our methodology to training and mitigation of congestion is scalable to many other regions and cities, and could help to drive a significantly larger use of big data in setting and executing urban policies and solutions. It also contributes to the scientific and professional debate on the role of machine learning in transportation. These results will provide useful models and insights for future studies.
