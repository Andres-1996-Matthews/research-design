## Title: Multivariate Time Series Analysis of Solar Irradiance for Photovoltaic Systems The Hybridization of NARX and LSTM Models

## Abstract:
The increasing global emphasis on renewable energy has underscored the need for accurate solar irradiance forecasting to optimize photovoltaic (PV) system performance and facilitate efficient energy management. Photovoltaic systems, despite their advantages, face challenges such as power instability and suboptimal power quality due to their dependency on meteorological conditions like cloud cover, temperature fluctuations, and wind speed. These factors, combined with the inherent unpredictability of weather patterns, make reliable forecasting a complex task.This project proposes a hybrid forecasting model combining Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to address these challenges. The hybrid model leverages the NARX network’s capability to model dynamic systems with external inputs and the LSTM network’s proficiency in handling long-term dependencies, aiming to deliver precise and reliable daily solar irradiance predictions. The model will be tailored to the tropical climate of Malaysia, where renewable energy is playing an increasingly pivotal role in the nation’s energy mix.Using historical weather data from Johor, Malaysia, the study will analyze the impact of key meteorological factors, including air temperature, cloud attenuation, precipitation rate, and wind characteristics, on solar irradiance. The outcomes will be visualized through an interactive dashboard, providing stakeholders with actionable insights for grid management and decision-making.By addressing critical gaps in renewable energy forecasting, this project is expected to enhance the stability and integration of PV systems into power grids, support Malaysia’s renewable energy goals, and contribute to the broader advancement of solar energy technologies.
