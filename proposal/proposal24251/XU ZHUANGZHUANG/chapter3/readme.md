### chapter3:Methodology
## 1. Business Understanding
Objective: Build a collaborative filtering recommendation system to predict user preferences and suggest products in an online shopping platform.
Problem Statement: Improve user experience and sales conversion rates by recommending relevant products to users based on their behavior and preferences.
## üìö 2. Data Sources and Data Collection Methods
a. Data Sources
You can use publicly available datasets or collect your own data:

Public Datasets:

Amazon Product Reviews Dataset: Contains user reviews, ratings, and metadata.
RetailRocket Dataset: Includes user interactions like clicks, purchases, and add-to-cart actions.
Instacart Dataset: Contains grocery shopping patterns.
Custom Data Collection:

Web Scraping: Extract product data and reviews from e-commerce websites.
APIs: Many e-commerce platforms (e.g., Shopify, Amazon API) provide APIs for accessing user data.
User Activity Logs: Track user clicks, purchases, and time spent on pages.
b. Data Collection Methods
Explicit Feedback: User-provided ratings and reviews.
Implicit Feedback: User clicks, purchases, browsing history, and cart additions.
Surveys and Questionnaires: For obtaining user preferences and satisfaction levels.
Timestamps: For tracking seasonal or temporal trends in shopping behavior.

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. Data Pre-processing
a. Data Cleaning:
Handle Missing Values: Remove or impute missing ratings, user IDs, or product IDs.
Remove Duplicates: Ensure no duplicate user-item interaction records.
Filter Sparse Data: Remove users or items with too few interactions.
b. Data Transformation:
Normalization: Scale numeric features (e.g., ratings) to a standard range (e.g., 0‚Äì1).
Encoding: Convert categorical features (e.g., product categories) into numerical format.
Timestamp Handling: Convert timestamps into meaningful features (e.g., day, month, season).
c. Feature Engineering:
User Behavior Features: Total purchases, average rating per user, session length.
Item Popularity: Number of purchases per item, average rating.
Temporal Features: Shopping trends during holidays, weekends, or specific hours.
d. Train-Test Split:
Split data into training (e.g., 80%) and testing (e.g., 20%) sets while preserving temporal order, if timestamps are critical.

## üìà 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze user purchase behavior patterns.
Understand item popularity distribution.
Visualize user-item interaction matrix to check sparsity.
Identify trends (e.g., seasonal shopping spikes).

## ü§ñ 5. Model Building (Collaborative Filtering)
a. Algorithm Selection:
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Similar users are recommended similar items.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommend items similar to what the user previously liked.
Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD, ALS): Decompose the user-item matrix into lower-dimensional matrices.
b. Model Training:
Train the collaborative filtering model using libraries such as:
Surprise Library
PySpark MLlib
TensorFlow Recommenders
c. Model Evaluation:
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
Precision@K
Recall@K
F1-Score

## üìä 6. Model Evaluation and Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search.
Validate model performance on test data.
Compare different collaborative filtering approaches.
## üöÄ 7. Deployment
Deploy the model using a platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
Integrate recommendations into the online shopping website/app.
Set up APIs for real-time recommendations.
üìà 8. Monitoring and Maintenance
Regularly update the model with fresh data.
Monitor recommendation performance using KPIs (e.g., Click-Through Rate, Conversion Rate).
Periodically retrain the model to adapt to changing user behavior.
