<hr>

<pre><b>Research Goal</b></pre>
###### The research goal is to address the challenges of delay prediction in sports equipment supply chains through advanced models.

<pre><b>Research Objectives</b></pre>
###### - To identify and preprocess historical sales and inventory data for missing values and seasonality.
###### - To analyze forecast results into actionable insights using Tableau and Power BI.
###### - To evaluate the performance of ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM models based on accuracy and reliability.

<pre><b>Research Questions</b></pre>
###### 1. What factors contribute to delays in the sports equipment supply chain?
###### 2. How does the performance of ARIMA + XGBoost compare to SARIMA in predicting inventory shortages?
###### 3. Can LSTM effectively predict long-term dependencies for better delay forecasts?

<pre><b>Hypothesis</b></pre>
###### This project hypothesizes that ARIMA + XGBoost improves delay prediction accuracy over traditional models like SARIMA.

<pre><b>Assumption</b></pre>
###### - Inventory shortages or overstock can be predicted in advance to build consumer confidence.
###### - External factors like weather, supplier reliability, and transportation overload require forecasting to mitigate risks.
###### - Seasonal demand peaks can be validated using forecasting models.

<pre><b>Significance of the Study</b></pre>
###### - Optimize supply chain management by comparing hybrid and traditional delay prediction models.
###### - Predict delay duration by turning uncontrollable factors into manageable variables.
###### - Assist sports equipment enterprises in reducing shortages, improving customer satisfaction, and lowering delay-associated costs.

<pre><b>Theoretical Framework</b></pre>
###### - **Theory of Constraints (TOC)**: Analyze bottlenecks causing delays.
###### - **Systems Theory**: Understand how disruptions in one part affect the entire system.
###### - **Predictive Analytics Theory**: Justify advanced forecasting models for delay prediction.

<pre><b>Conceptual Framework</b></pre>
###### - **Independent Variables**: Transportation time, supplier reliability, demand variability, weather conditions.
###### - **Dependent Variables**: Inventory shortages.
###### - **Moderating Variables**: Seasonal demand, predictive accuracy.
