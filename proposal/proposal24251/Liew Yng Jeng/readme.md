## Title: Delay Prediction On Inventory Shortages In Sports Equipment Supply Chain

## Abstract:
In the dynamic landscape of modern supply chain management, predicting delays and inventory shortages has become increasingly critical for maintaining efficiency and customer satisfaction. This study focuses on delay prediction and inventory management in the sports equipment supply chain, leveraging a hybrid approach combining statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMA) and machine learning techniques (XGBoost, LSTM). This research aims to minimize out-of-stock situations, overstocking, and shipment delays by analyzing historical sales and inventory data. Additionally, it addresses the limitations of traditional methods, such as inadequate handling of seasonality and non-linear patterns, by introducing advanced predictive models. The findings contribute to optimizing inventory management, enhancing forecast accuracy, and supporting data-driven decision-making processes in competitive supply chain environments.
