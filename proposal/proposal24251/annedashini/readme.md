## Title: Nutritional Deficiency Prediction by Region Using Machine Learning

## Abstract:
Nutritional deficiencies are one of the major global issue in human health growth especially on specific reasons like low and middle income areas, where thousands of people, mainly kids and pregnant woman who suffer from insufficient intake of proper diet with full of vital micro nutrients.These nutrition deficiency are linked to various serious health issues such as stunted growth, health impairments, weak immune systems and high mortality rates. The usual traditional approaches to detect and identify nutritional deficiency, including surveys and interventions, tend to be expensive and inefficient.Consequently, there is a more pressure needed for more targeted, data-driven solutions to analyze regions and populations that are most harmful.This paper explains the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict and analyze nutritional deficiencies in different areas. By combining various data sets on health conditions, socioeconomic, environmental and dietary factors this paper goals to build model predictive models that can list out regions that are at high risk for deficiencies.Machine learning has the potential to define complex, non-linear patterns within large datasets,which been using often in traditional methods.These insights could help improve public health outcomes.
