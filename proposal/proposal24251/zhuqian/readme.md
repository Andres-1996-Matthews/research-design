## Title: Topic-Based Analysis of Social Media Posts Using RNN and LSTM

## Abstract:
The rise of social media as a platform for public expression has generated both valuable data and challenges concerning its quality. Unlike traditional media, social media offers direct access to real-time public sentiment, presenting opportunities for enterprises and governments to gain insights. However, fake users, internet trolls, and irrelevant content undermine the reliability of this data. Similarly, traditional web surveys often fail to verify respondent authenticity, compromising results. This research applies data science and machine learning techniques to filter and analyze topic-based social media posts, aiming to provide a more reliable data source. By identifying key relationships between content and topics, building analytical models, and assessing public reactions, this study aims to improve data quality and reduce dependence on traditional surveys. The findings could offer valuable insights for decision-makers and provide a more efficient, cost-effective method for gathering public opinion. 

## Keywords:
