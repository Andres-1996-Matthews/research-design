## 1.1 Introduction

Traffic congestion is a worldwide problem resulting in many urban and regional areas, including Malaysia. Bringing shoulder to shoulder with an insufficient number of road users, vehicle congestion and ineffective traffic control, can cause less delays, higher fuel spending, rising air pollution, and reduced commercial efficiency. Evidently, the challenges require good understanding of the traffic problem and end line congestion. The congestion in traffic congestion is quite clear in urban areas such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and Johor Bahru. This periodic traffic jam is a problem not limited to urban areas, but also from cities to rural areas. Such as geographical a map, each location has its own population and other traffic congestion problems. Observation and signal management approaches and design should be tailored to local conditions and patterns. This indicator includes a series of traders whose cars are delayed and the level of road congestion is estimated. As the congestion indicator is the future of road congestion, the use of napolis will be more abundant than the road, the greater the traffic within the road. Transportation improvement and vehicle safety driving, infrastructure and other drivers have expressed great attention to traffic jam in the region. This paper will be the line of the station to predict regional highways in Malaysia. Use all kinds of traffic grading software to actually get off on a different topic. Objectives Description dataset to different formats such as training, test data, weather and road works and databaseWarning is the event of any of the data.achers the use of historically or monthly and weekly features, such as weather and road works, as data collection for the examination of traffic. Try to romantic congestion stop.odificaciones and moving and training. Furthermore, the model may be implemented in a state-level analysis to identify traffic trends and AKIs that contribute to congestion in different states across the country. Specifically, an analytical comparison of major traffic patterns across states will be performed. Lastly, the study will propose key recommendations based on the prediction of the mathematical modeling as well as insight from the first and second analysis that may be effectively implemented for traffic management purposes. By contributing data-driven methods to alleviate traffic congestion in cities, this research aims to impact national or regional transportation policies on a significant scale. The potential improvements in traffic flow can create better commutes, a more environmentally friendly way to travel, and encourages economic growth. The study is impactful at a scale as it provides first-tier data and algorithmic output to city and state traffic planning department, where real-world problems require efficient and practical segregation from data driving devices.

## 1.2 Problem Background
Malaysia is located in Southeast Asia that has seen its cities and economy urbanize quite   rapidly in the past decade. Growing with major cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and   Johor Bahru, Malaysia is also home to a very large number of traveling population, and the number of vehicles on the road has increased at a rate higher than the number of vehicles. Such data on the usage of the road is a significant contributor to the current state of traffic congestion in Malaysia. The impact of congestion extends over all major
socioeconomic metrics, predicts higher consumption of time and fuel by commuters, lower rate of economic productivity, and even an increase in air pollution attributed to acrid fuel  burn and waste. In Malaysia there are a vast majority of hotspots that are the cause of
congestion. The vast number of jurisdictions is of an entirely different geocentric location, and with often a rural village at the distance, there can be an extremely difference in the ability of the jurisdiction to invest in its roads and people. The management of traffic congestion in Malaysia has historically been managed by large capital capital spending, some of which are the new roads, new crossings, and converting existing thoroughfares to rural highways. However, not only is this approach one of the least productive during fiscal periods, there can be disparity in the way money is spent, some often spotting the expressway speedway should be two-lane. In a time where money and efficiency are the    goal of a great society, the scientific data science approach can come to addinventively in the planning and management of traffic congestion in cities and states of Malaysia.

## 1.3 Problem Statement
Traffic congestion is a widespread issue influenced by various factors such as traffic volume, road conditions, weather, and public events. Analyzing and addressing this problem is complex. Traditional methods of managing traffic have often failed to effectively control traffic volume and provide a smoother experience for commuters.
