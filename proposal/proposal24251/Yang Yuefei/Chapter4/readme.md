# Chapter4 Initial Results

## 4.1 Overview
In this section, we conducted an in - depth exploratory data analysis to gain a better understanding of the traffic - related datasets collected for the study of traffic congestion in Malaysia.

## 4.2 Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. It helps uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.
When it comes to optimizing traffic congestion, EDA can be applied in the following ways:
Understanding the traffic data patterns, EDA can use statistical methods(correlation analysis and so on...) to calculate correlations between traffic congestion and various factors. Many factors related to traffic, such as the type of road (e.g., freeway, local street) or the day of the week, are categorical. EDA helps in encoding these variables in a way that they can be used in predictive models. For example, one - hot encoding can convert categorical variables into numerical values that machine - learning algorithms can process. This enables the development of more accurate models for predicting traffic congestion.
Our main sources are as follows：
traffic volume data
Weather data
Historical accident data
Public Transportation Ridership Data
