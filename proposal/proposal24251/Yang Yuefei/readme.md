## Title: Optimization of urban traffic in Malaysia using machine learning algorithm

## Abstract:
Traffic congestion is a worldwide problem resulting in many urban and regional areas, Including Malaysia. Bringing shoulder to shoulder with an insufficient number of road users, Vehicle congestion and ineffective traffic control, can cause less delays, higher fuel Spending, rising air pollution, and reduced commercial efficiency. Evidently, the challenges require good understanding of the traffic problem and end line congestion. The congestion in traffic congestion is quite clear in urban areas such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and Johor Bahru. This periodic traffic jam is a problem not limited to urban areas, but also from cities to rural areas. Such as geographical a map, each location has its own population and othertraffic congestion problems.
The study is impactful at a scale as it provides first-tier data and algorithmic output to city and state traffic planning department, where real-world problems require efficient and practical segregation from data driving devices.

## Keywords: 
traffic congestion, machine learning
