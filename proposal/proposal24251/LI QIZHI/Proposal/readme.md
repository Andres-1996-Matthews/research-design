Name: LI QIZHI
Matric No: MCS241026

---

## Introduction:
This project purposes to apply the time series analysis methodology to make the projection of the financial markets in the future. Through the exploration of historical market data and identification of some determinants, we are going to make a predictive model, which will be able to provide significant insights to both the businesses and the investors.

---

## Problem Background:
The identification of the accurate trend line is an essential task for enterprises and stock traders in making guided decisions. Time series analysis presents one of the most accurate methods of studying market behavior and predicting trends. All the same, the conventional methods of trend analysis often overlook the financial market's complexity. 

---

## Problem Statement:

The complex task is in the development of a proper and precise time series model that is able future market trends as a result of using historical data and the identification of key factors who helped to push the market one way or another at that point of time. 

---

## Aim of the Project:
The target of this study is the use of time series forecasting equations in order to come out with a forecasting model that will provide an accurate trend to follow. 

---

## Objectives of the Project:

1.Master the theory and practice of time series forecasting. 
2.Get market data, as well as clean it for analysis. 
3.Find out market trends and understand the main factors of influence. 
4.Create a time series prediction model and put it to a test. 
5. Translate results into concrete advises and suggestions for businesses and fund managers based on model forecasts.

## Scopes of the Project:

The subject market will be selected (e.g., stock market, real estate market, commodity market), and the prediction model will be built using past data. The generation of this model will be done by using a set of different evaluation parameters in order to check the reliability of the model as well as its accuracy.

## Expected Contribution of the Project:

Initiating a deeply built workflow for the market analysis in terms of the rising and falling market tendencies. Establishing a robust and precise time series data model to make future price predictions. Delivering viable insights and advice for companies and funds managers, which will be based on the model's predictions.
