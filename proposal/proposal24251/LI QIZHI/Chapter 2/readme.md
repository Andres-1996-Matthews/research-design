### 2.1 Introduction 
The financial market trades with prevailing economic conditions and is hence vital for businesses and investors because of its volatility. More accurate forecasting of the market's dynamics can help businesses establish fairer and more efficient strategies and may also enable the investors to put their money in the place that gives them the best return. Nonetheless, the complexities of the financial market make it hard for any offline prediction mechanism to understand the heightened interactions.Because the key factors that affect market trends include: economic indicators, company performance indicators and investor sentiment indicators. This literature review discusses the impact of these factors and uses time series models such as ARIMA, SARIMA and exponential smoothing for accurate forecasting.
## 2.2 Economic Indicators 
Among economic indicators, Macroeconomic factors like GDP, inflation, and interest rates are crucial for understanding market trends. (Levitt, A. 2008)These indicators shed light on the viable and developing prospects of the ultra-modern economy influencing a vast range of sectors, businesses, and consumer behavior. Gross Domestic Product (GDP): GDP represents the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period (Samuelson &Nordhaus, 2010)The growing GDP indicates a vibrant economy where people are employed and spend more. A sustained decline in GDP could mean the economy is not growing, stagnating, or going into a recession stage (Romer, 2012). Not only does this knowledge of GDP movement spur business and policymakers in anticipating shifts, it also helps in demand and investment pattern projection (Mankiw, 2014).Inflation: Inflation, that is, the rate at which an average price level of commodities and services generally rises, is a key element in all economic analysis (Blanchard,2017). Normal inflation rates demonstrate that the economy is advancing, while room for folly is identified by those who despise excessive inflations and how it influences the purchasing power and confidence of the consumer (Friedman, 1968).Central banks engage in the implementation of monetary policy as a way of influencing the economy by controlling the interest rates and the money supply(Mishkin, 2015).Interest Rates: Interest rates, which are mainly the concern of the central banks, are the most significant reason in the running of the economy through determining borrowing, investing, and saving trends (Bernanke, 2010). The result of high-interest rates is to make borrowing unattractive so as reduce the money circulation in the economy, while low-interest rates might encourage spending and borrowing which in return may stimulate the growth of the economy (Clarida, Gali, & Gertler, 1999). The relationship between interest rates and inflation is key in the management of the macro economy. Given, central banks have to adjust their rates accordingly in order to curb inflation to ensure that the economy is stable (Taylor, 1993).

### 1.3 Statement of the Problem
A good financial forecasting model for the financial market is a complex job in which one has to take stock of the fundamental factors: Data Quality: These elements are the necessary statistics, compliance, and confirmation for making an accurate collection of predictions. Determinants: Market behavior depends on a number of different factors, and the selection of the key elements is one of the most important things to consider. Model Selection: It is really important to select an appropriate model considering not only the data characteristics but also the main goals of the prediction. Model Evaluation: Evaluation of the selected model involves a consideration of the specified outcomes and (or) use of the additional outcome indicators.

### 1.4 Research Questions
What factors are of more weight in the move of stock markets? We will also specify the variables related to economy, company, and investors' opinion as we try to find the drivers of the markets themselves. How to set up a solid and accurate time series model that will advise us about market trends? We will be introduced to the Arima, SARIMA model and Exponential Smoothing method and find out the most suitable way to predict market trends. How trust can we describe the model in terms of future related market movements? Historical data will be used for the back testing approach, and different parameters and the prediction accuracy level of the model will be done by using the selected indicators. To convey the model prognosis as advice being addressed to entrepreneurs and their funds: Businesspeople and investors will receive advice based on market statistics, and potential risks, and outlook based on model prediction, and take appropriate action.

### 1.5 Objectives of the Research
Learn in depth the time series forecasting methods both theoretically and practically: We will study the most basic principles and techniques of time series, and also we implement different time series forecasting models. Acquiring market data and handling it: We will collect the data that would be necessary through data scraping, clean it, and will carry-out other data management tasks. Discerning the main market directions and the key influences: Through application of statistical analysis methods, it is possible to answer questions about market trends and writings of the same. Establishing a time series prediction model and validating it: We will consider the knowledge base and the intended goals as we choose a model and apply historical data for testing its efficiency. Results Revealed from Model Forecasts traversing several areas including business and funds: We are going to analyze market trends and judge the risks related to it with the help of model prediction results, such that advice and suggestions could be offered to business men and investors.

### 1.6 Scope of the Study
The study includes the selection of a specific area (e.g., stock market, real estate market) and the development of the prediction model based on historical data. The model is constructed at this stage by treating a different set of test parameters to test for the provision of accurate and reliable forecast.

### 1.7 Significance of the study
This analysis will offer a comprehensive plan for market analysis, which will be devoted to predicting the market movements through an analysis of trends and determinants. It also takes a step to put up a robust and declarative time series model, which would give helpful suggestions on the future prices. Besides, we may offer valuable advice and solutions for entrepreneurs and fund managers backed up with the help of model forecasts, which can help them in searching for a niche in the market and making the right decisions.
