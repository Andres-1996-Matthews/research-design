# IDENTIFYING PATTERNS IN DRUG EFFICACY BY ANALYZING DRUG REVIEWS THROUGH A CLUSTERING APPROACH

## Chapter 2: Literature Review

### Overview
This project explores the combined use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and clustering techniques to evaluate drug efficacy through patient reviews.

Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluating drug efficacy in controlled environments. However, their limited inclusion of diverse populations leaves a gap in understanding real-world drug performance, including side effects and varying effectiveness. Patient reviews bridge this gap by offering valuable insights based on real-world experiences. However, these reviews may also include biases influenced by individual patient preferences, necessitating advanced analysis methods.

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, excel at extracting meaningful information from textual data by understanding sentiments, context, and relationships within words, phrases, and sentences. LLMs outperformed than the traditional text analysis methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) by capturing the nuances and context of the text. Despite their advantages, LLMs face challenges in grouping similar side effects or effectiveness due to limitations in identifying similarities between words or phrases.

To address these limitations, clustering techniques are applied. By grouping similar features from patient reviews, clustering enhances the identification of patterns, reducing dataset complexity and improving the overall analysis.

In summary, the integration of LLMs and clustering techniques provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing drug reviews. While LLMs retrieve meaningful insights, clustering techniques group similar data points, enabling the identification of patterns in drug efficacy with greater precision.
