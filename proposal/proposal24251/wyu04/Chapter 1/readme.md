# Identifying Patterns in Drug Efficacy by Analyzing Drug Reviews through a Clustering Approach

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### Overview
The project addresses the growing of process that relying on reviews for decision-making, including the importance of patient drug reviews in healthcare. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluating drug efficacy under controlled conditions, their limited generalizability to diverse populations leaves gaps in understanding real-world drug performance, including side effects and varying effectiveness.

Patient reviews provide valuable insights into drug efficacy, capturing unreported experiences and long-term effects. This research leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract meaningful information from patient drug reviews and applies clustering techniques to uncover patterns in drug efficacy. By bridging the gap between RCT findings and real-world scenarios, this study aims to improve clinical decision-making and treatment plans.

Project focus on:
1. Preprocessing drug review datasets for analysis.
2. Extracting relevant keywords using LLMs.
3. Implementing clustering techniques (e.g., DBSCAN) to group reviews based on similarities and visualizing the results.

The research uses data from the UCI Irvine Machine Learning Repository, Python for programming, and ChatGPT for extracting insights about drug effectiveness and side effects. By identifying meaningful patterns, the project seeks to enhance healthcare professionals' understanding of drug performance across diverse patient populations, enabling more informed decisions and better therapy strategies.
