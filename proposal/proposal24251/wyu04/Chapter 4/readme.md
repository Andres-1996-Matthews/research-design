# IDENTIFYING PATTERNS IN DRUG EFFICACY BY ANALYZING DRUG REVIEWS THROUGH A CLUSTERING APPROACH

## Chapter 4: Research Design And Implementation

### Overview
In this chapter, the steps to obtain the clusters based on side effects and effectiveness ad been introduced. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was carried out to investigate the dataset. Then, data preparation was done by handling the missing data and duplicates data that was presented in the dataset. After obtaining a cleaned dataset, the review column in the dataset was further retrieved by LLM to identify the side effects and effectiveness of the drug.
