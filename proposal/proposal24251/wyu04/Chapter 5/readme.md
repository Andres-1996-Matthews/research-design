# IDENTIFYING PATTERNS IN DRUG EFFICACY BY ANALYZING DRUG REVIEWS THROUGH A CLUSTERING APPROACH

## Chapter 5: Discussion and Future Works

### Overview
Achievements for this research are: 
1. A cleaned dataset can be retrieved by removing the duplicates and handling the missing values and irrelevant information that occurred in the dataset.
2. ChatGPT API was called to retrieve the features that wish to analysis further.

Future works in MDS Project II are: 
1. Successfully retrieved the features of side effects and effectiveness from drug reviews.
2. Clustering techniques such as DBSCAN were implemented and formed different groups of clusters for the side effects and effectiveness.
3. Validation the clusters formed with silhouette coefficients.
