## Title: Identifying Patterns in Drug Efficacy by Analyzing Drug Reviews through A Clustering Approach

## Abstract:
The randomization process in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) restrict the involvement of diverse population with various health status and demographic information. Even though RCTs able to provide a reliable outcome of the drug performance, but it failed to represent the drug performance in real-world scenarios. The increase in the use of social media lead to the increase in the people to share their experience or opinion regarding the services and products that they had utilized on the Internet. Therefore, the drug efficacy from various perspectives can be derived from the drug reviews. This project aims to identify patterns in drug efficacy to enhance the understanding of drug performance across diverse patient populations by utilizing large language models (LLMs) and clustering techniques in patient drug reviews. In this research, the drug reviews will be undergoing the data preparation process to handle the irrelevant information, duplicates and missing values that present in the dataset. Then, LLMs such as ChatGPT 4o mini will be called to run the data derivation process. The information of side effects and effectiveness of drugs will be identified from the reviews made by consumers. Then, clustering techniques such as densitybased spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) will be implemented to cluster the retrieved features. Lastly, the performance of the model will be evaluated by silhouette coefficients. The insights of clustering results will then be further visualized by dashboard. In conclusion, the used of LLMs and clustering techniques in this research tends to narrow the gap between RCTs and real-world scenarios. The important features obtained from the drug reviews allowed the healthcare professionals to have a better understanding of drug performance in a diverse population. Therefore, the treatment strategies can be further improved due to the valuable insights derived from the drug reviews.
