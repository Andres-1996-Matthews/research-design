# MDS Project
**Title:** 
Identifying Patterns in Drug Efficacy by Analyzing Drug Reviews through A Clustering Approach

**Problem Statement:**
The lack of comprehensive information from randomized clinical trials limit the understanding of drugs efficacy in diverse patient populations. 

**Aim of the Project:**
The aim of the project is to identify patterns in drug efficacy to enhance the understanding of drug performance across diverse patient populations by utilizing Large Language Models and clustering techniques in patient drug reviews.

**Objectives of the Project:**
1.	To conduct a preprocessing of the drug reviews dataset for drug efficacy analysis
2.	To extract relevant keywords from the preprocessed dataset by using Large Language Models
3.	To implement clustering techniques to categorize the extracted keywords and visualize the findings

**Expected Contribution of the Project:**
- Enhancing the clinical decision-making process by healthcare professionals.
- Providing the real-world scenarios to medical professionals regarding the drug performance and help patients to choose their treatment plans.

**Algorithm and Techniques Used:**
1. **Large Language Models:** ChatGPT API
2. **Clustering Approach:** DBSCAN
