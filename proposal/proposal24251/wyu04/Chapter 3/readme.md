# IDENTIFYING PATTERNS IN DRUG EFFICACY BY ANALYZING DRUG REVIEWS THROUGH A CLUSTERING APPROACH

## Chapter 3: Research Methodology

### Overview
There were five phases of research to identify the drug efficacy. Each phase contributed to a milestone. 

Phase one is research planning and initial study which contributed to problem formulation and background research. A milestone of an overview of point of interest can be identified and enable an insight into the whole project. 

Besides that, data preparation fell into phase two in which a cleaned dataset that was ready for further analyzation was well-prepared. 

Furthermore, phase three is to retrieve the relevant features from the pre-processed dataset. In this phase, the underlying pattern of the dataset can be identified by LLMs. 

Additionally, DBSCAN clustering model will be implemented into the retrieved features to classify the data based on their similarities. In this case, a milestone of drug categories on their effectiveness can be illustrated. 

Lastly, silhouette coefficient was applied for model evaluation. The relationship between drugs and its performance can be visualized in this phase.
