# RESEARCH DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

This chapter contains graphical analysis of player review datasets from 5 genres with 25 games that have been collected, where insights from visualization and descriptive statistics will be revealed. Feature engineering will also be discussed in order to create, modify, and select features or variables in datasets to improve machine learning performance. This chapter also carries out feature extraction to convert textual data (reviews) into numeric, so that reviews can be combined with other numeric features (e.g., review length, play hours). Finally, a machine learning model will be introduced to generate initial insights.
