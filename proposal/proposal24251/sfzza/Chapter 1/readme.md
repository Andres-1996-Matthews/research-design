# ANALYZING PLAYER FEEDBACK IN STEAM REVIEW ACROSS GAME GENRES

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### Overview

Steam, as one of the largest gaming platforms, enables players to share their experiences through reviews. However, its review system simplifies feedback into “recommended” and “not recommended” labels, which limits game developers’ ability to fully understand what players appreciate or criticize about their games.

Game genres, defined by gameplay characteristics, significantly influence the kind of feedback games receive. Some genres face critiques on storylines, while others gain praise despite technical limitations. This study addresses how sentiment analysis can uncover deeper insights into player feedback across genres.

The research identifies gaps in the current review system and aims to analyze feedback trends using sentiment analysis. It focuses on five popular genres: Action, RPG, FPS, Strategy, and Indie, examining 100 reviews for five games in each genre. By analyzing positive and negative reviews, the study will provide actionable insights for developers, helping them enhance their games by focusing on the aspects most valued within each genre.

This chapter establishes the research’s foundation, covering the problem background, research questions, and objectives. It also emphasizes the significance of understanding nuanced feedback to bridge the gap between player expectations and game development.
