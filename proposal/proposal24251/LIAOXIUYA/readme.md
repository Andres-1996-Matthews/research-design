## Title: Global Electric Vehicle Market: Historical Analysis and Future Predictions (2010-2030)

## Introduction:
The global automotive industry has experienced a significant shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) since 2010. Driven by technological advancements, supportive government policies, and increased environmental awareness, EVs have seen rapid growth and are projected to dominate the market by 2030. Data science plays a crucial role in this transformation. By utilizing tools such as predictive modeling, machine learning, and time series analysis, data scientists can analyze historical sales data, identify trends, and forecast future market behavior.
For this study, data is collected from Kaggle and the IEA Global EV Data Explorer, both of which provide comprehensive datasets on global EV sales. The focus is on data from prominent countries known for significant EV adoption and market influence, including the United States, China, Germany, and Norway. These datasets encompass historical sales figures, charging infrastructure, and other relevant metrics from 2010 to 2020. By leveraging these rich datasets, the research aims to explore global EV sales trends and provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry.
