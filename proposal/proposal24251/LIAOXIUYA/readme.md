## Title: Predictions With Global Electric Vehicle Market




## Introduction:
The global automotive industry has experienced a significant shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) since 2010. Driven by technological advancements, supportive government policies, and increased environmental awareness, EVs have seen rapid growth and are projected to dominate the market by 2030. Data science plays a crucial role in this transformation. By utilizing tools such as predictive modeling, machine learning, and time series analysis, data scientists can analyze historical sales data, identify trends, and forecast future market behavior.
For this study, data is collected from Kaggle and the IEA Global EV Data Explorer, both of which provide comprehensive datasets on global EV sales. The focus is on data from prominent countries known for significant EV adoption and market influence, including the United States, China, Germany, and Norway. These datasets encompass historical sales figures, charging infrastructure, and other relevant metrics from 2010 to 2020. By leveraging these rich datasets, the research aims to explore global EV sales trends and provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry.

## Problem Statement:
In recent years, the rapid development of the automotive industry and the global shift to electric vehicles (EVs) are reshaping the automotive industry and spawning a wide range of electric vehicles. This trend has also attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. This study will make specific analysis and predictions on this trend, specifically:

1. Historical trend analysis: It is necessary to analyze historical sales data of various types of electric vehicles to identify the main trends and patterns that have emerged since 2010. Understanding and analyzing these data is an important prerequisite for predicting future development trends of the global electric vehicle industry.

2. Predicting future trends: Accurate predictions of future electric vehicle development trends are crucial to stakeholders, including automakers, policymakers, and investors. This requires the application of advanced data science techniques, such as predictive modeling and machine learning, to predict sales trends from 2023 to 2030.

## Aim of the Project:
The goal of this study is to use the data sets of Kaggle and IEA Global EV Data Explorer to focus on major countries with high electric vehicle penetration and market influence in the world, so as to fully understand the dynamics of the electric vehicle market and effectively analyze and predict the future development of the electric vehicle industry.

## Objectives of the Project:
1. To Analyze historical trends: Examine the sales data of various types of electric vehicles in major countries around 
the world from 2010 to 2020 to identify and analyze the main trend characteristics.
2. To Forecasting future sales: Leverage machine learning and time series analysis to develop forecasting models to 
forecast EV sales trends through 2030.
3. To Evaluate influencing factors: Evaluate the impact of technological advances, government policies, market 
dynamics, and consumer preferences on all types of electric vehicles.
4. To Deliver strategic insights: Advise automakers, policymakers, and investors to support informed decision-making 
and strategic planning.

## Scopes of the Project:
1.	Historical sales data: Analyze global EV sales from 2010 to 2020, with a focus on key country markets.
2.	Technological Advancements: Assess the impact of energy options and vehicle design improvements.
3.	Government policy: Evaluate the impact of policies, incentives, and regulations.
4.	Market dynamics: Understand consumer preferences and economic factors.
5.	Predictive modeling: Develop models to forecast EV sales trends through 2030.

## Expected Contribution of the Project:
1.	EV Market Trend Analysis: Provides a detailed analysis of global EV sales trends from 2010 to 2020, highlighting the trends driving changes in key markets such as the US, China, Germany, and Norway.
2.	Future Sales Forecast: Develop forecasting models to predict EV trends in 2030, providing valuable forecasts.
3.	Impact Analysis: Evaluate the impact of technological advancements, government policies, etc. on the EV market, and provide a comprehensive understanding of the various vehicle development trends in the EV market.
4.	Strategic Advice: Provide valuable insights and recommendations to automakers, policymakers, and investors to support informed decision-making and strategic planning for the future electric market.
