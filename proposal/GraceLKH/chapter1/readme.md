## Chapter 1: Introduction
### 1.1 Introduction
Climate change is one of the most exigent natural events which is identified by persistent shifts in temperature and weather patterns. Human activities such as fuel combustion and deforestation have significantly increased greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations since Industrial Revolution, resulting in increased global temperatures, changed patterns of precipitation, and more frequent severe weather events. Wildfire is an unplanned, interface fire, independency fire or vegetative fire spread rapidly through the plant biomass involving its layers. For instance, climatic change aggravates these fires by such conditions as high temperatures, low humidities, long periods of drought and changing winds that progress the development of fires.

Nonetheless, the considerations have been historically significant to ecosystem maintenance even though wildfires are generally known as destructive phenomena. However, today’s fires are more negative and large-scaled owing to climatic change and human influence. The instances of the USA Great Fire of 1910 or Australian Bushfire Season (2019- 2020) assert that fire in forest is rather frequent and might be extremely severe; hence, there is a paramount need to adopt proper fire management strategies. In Peninsular Malaysia with tropical climate, it becomes relatively more dangerous for the forests to burn during the dry season periods. It was formerly relevant to slash and burn of agricultural practices but today it has been made more frequent and severe by urbanization through deforesting and climate variations. This has been occasioned by the occurrence of El Nino event 1997-1998 and drought episodes of 1983-1984 creating concern in effective way these unfavourable natural events can be managed. Understanding of the climate’s relationship with fires has become more important after the improvement of data and information gathering and processing. 

Therefore, this research aim is to determine the effects that climatic factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity and wind strength have on forest fires in Peninsular Malaysia for at least five years’ data on fire occurrences in the forests and the climatic data of those years. In addition, the goals of the study are to analyse trends, compare the data and find the correlation between the climate and forest fire occurrences; to combine data on the weather conditions of the analysed regions and develop methods and models for the evaluation of the fire risks, and then offer the improvements for the management of such scenarios. Therefore, prior literature in other regions is still available, but the literature on Peninsular Malaysia is limited, and the data sources and methods used are often insufficient and not highly developed. This research intends to fill those gaps employing statistical techniques which include time series analysis, adding a significant contribution to the topic of environmental management and climate influences on forest fires.

### 1.2 Problem Background
Climate change has worsened the situation whereby forest fires have become an environmental and socio-economic problem in areas such as Peninsular Malaysia. Wildfires has great impact to biodiversity, human well-being, and economic stability. More extensive intense bush fires, associated with climate change and longer dry seasons require more studies for the causes and patterns of the disastrous events for better strategies in firefighting to mitigate ecological damage and safeguard public health and financial assets.

There are plenty previous studies that analysed the relationship between forest fires and climate factors in different areas. For example, Turco et al.’s study in 2014 explains how increased temperature and decreased in precipitation contributes to fire. While Flannigan et al. in 2005 analysed historical data which highlighted the changes in the temperature and amount of precipitation affects the frequency and severity of fire. The study by Balshi et al. (2009) on the Alaskan boreal habitat used dynamic vegetation modelling in predicting the increasing trend in size and frequency of burning under various climates’ conditions. These results imply that to stop the increase of this trend, management strategies that are tailored for the region should be developed. Ensuring the sustainability of used natural resources in operational strategies designed for management of climatic change across affected regions, special critical climatic aspects must be put into consideration. Thus, studies on specific fire management strategies are crucial for the mitigation of environmental shifts and other climate change realities to protect the requisites of society as well as its welfare.

### 1.3 Problem Statement
Even though climatic factors have been identified as a major cause of forest fires all over the world, knowledge on temporal patterns and climate on forest fire in Peninsular Malaysia is limited. This resulted from inadequate data and analysis not yet been undertaken in particular area of interest (Chew et al., 2022). This gap has excluded the possibility of proper management of the forest fires in the country and therefore risk the countries biological diversity future health of the people and the circulatory economy. It is therefore important to fill this knowledge gap to explain the factors leading to such fires; and to improve on the management decisions of forest fires. Undoubtedly, there is a desire to raise research efforts to develop a better early warning system that would be instrumental in the mitigation of the risks of forest fires in the region of Peninsular Malaysia.
