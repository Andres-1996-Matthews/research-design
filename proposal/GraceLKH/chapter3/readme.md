This chapter highlighted the structured approach taken to analyse the temporal patterns of forest fires in Peninsular Malaysia and their climatic influences using statistical methods. The chapter begin with stating the research design for this study, following by explaining the data science project life cycle which describes data sources, data collection methods and data pre-processing steps. In the next session, it continued with describing the data analysis, defining evaluation metrics and lastly comparing the methods used in previous studies with those proposed in this research and identified the research gap.

### 3.2 Research Design
The studyâ€™s research design is observational, which is suitable for understanding and analysing the existing patterns and relationships between climatic variables and forest fire occurrences. This design enables the gathering of information from natural settings without manipulating variables, ensuring that the findings are reflective of real-world scenarios. The choice of an observational design is justified by the need to analyse historical data to identify trends and correlations, which is essential for developing predictive models and management strategies.

### 3.3 Data Science Project Life Cycle
The Data Science Project Life Cycle (Figure 3.3) is a systematic approach that guides the progression of a data-driven project from initial problem definition to deployment and maintenance of the solution. This cycle encompasses a series of interconnected stages designed to ensure thorough understanding, accurate analysis, and effective implementation of data-centric solutions. Every step in the process builds on the one before it, leading to a cohesive workflow that improves the accuracy and usefulness of the outcomes. The data science project life cycle followed in this session includes the first three stages: problem formulation, data collection and data pre-processing. The other stages such as data exploration will be discussed in Chapter 4, model building will be presented in Chapter 5, and the last two stages: deployment and monitoring and maintenance will be outlined in Chapter 7.

#### 3.3.1 Problem Formulation
Forest fires in Peninsular Malaysia pose significant risks to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human settlements. Understanding the temporal patterns of these fires and their climatic influences is crucial for developing effective fire management strategies and early warning systems.

#### 3.3.2 Data Source and Data Collection
Data was gathered from Google Earth Engine for this research to ensure a thorough examination of the factors that impact forest fire trends. The dataset on forest fires and climate change in Peninsular Malaysia is obtained from multiple-source remote sensing data through google earth engine. This platform integrates data from various satellites and provides high-resolution imagery, generates not only relevant dataset for forest fire but also execute climate variables such as temperature, humidity, windspeed and other relevant indicators, offering valuable insights into the climatic factors influencing forest fires. The dataset size is approximately 82.89M which covered the forest fire and climate variables attributes from 2001 to 2023 years (Figure 3.3.2).

#### Step 1: Data Cleaning
Data cleansing is the initial phase in the preprocessing stage, aimed at enhancing the dataset's quality by removing or correcting inaccuracies and inconsistencies. This involves removing duplicate records to avoid redundancy and eliminating irrelevant data points that do not contribute to the analysis. Handling missing values is another essential part of data cleaning, which can be done through imputation methods, such as filling in empty data entries with the mean, median, or mode, or by removing records with missing data if the proportion is insignificant. Additionally, filtering out noise and outliers is crucial to prevent skewed analysis results. Statistical methods such as z-scores or IQR (Interquartile Range) can be utilised in detecting and addressing the outliers.

#### Step 2: Data Transformation
Following the cleaning process, data transformation ensures that the data is in a format suitable for analysis. Normalizing and standardizing the data is a critical step to ensure consistency across the dataset, especially when dealing with variables that operate on different scales. This procedure consists of adjusting numerical data to a uniform scale without altering variations in the values' ranges. Converting categorical variables into numerical formats is also essential for statistical analysis, which can be achieved by using methods such as label encoding or one-hot encoding. Aggregating data to appropriate temporal and spatial scales ensures that the analysis captures the relevant patterns and trends. For instance, weather data might be aggregated on a daily or monthly basis to match the temporal resolution of fire incident data.

#### Step 3: Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves generating new features using available data to improve the efficacy of the models. This involves leveraging domain knowledge to generate features that capture critical aspects of the data. For example, calculating fire weather indices such as the Fire Weather Index (FWI) or the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) can provide insights into fire risk levels. Analysing time-related characteristics, such as the specific day or time of year, helps in understanding the seasonal patterns of forest fires. Additionally, generating interaction terms between climatic variables (e.g., interaction between temperature and humidity) can help in capturing the combined effects of multiple factors on fire occurrences.

These initial processing tasks together guarantee that the dataset is ready to use for future analysis steps, enhancing the quality and reliability of the insights derived from the statistical models.

### 3.4 Data Analysis
The data analysis involves employing advanced statistical methods to process and analyse the collected data. Time series analysis and regression models are used to quantify the relationship between climatic factors and fire patterns, offering a robust analytical framework. These techniques are suitable for handling the high-resolution temporal data and identifying significant trends and correlations.

### 3.5 Evaluation Metrics
The research's effectiveness is measured using defined evaluation metrics. These metrics help determine whether the findings support the research question and objectives. Examples of evaluation metrics include:

-	Prediction Accuracy: The accuracy of the models in predicting fire occurrences based on climatic variables.
-	Error Rates: Methods like mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are utilized for evaluating the model's performance.
-	Model Robustness: The ability of the models to generalize to new data and avoid overfitting, assessed through cross-validation techniques.

### 3.6 Comparison of Methods
