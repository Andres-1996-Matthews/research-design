After simple data processing, the mean, median, standard deviation, and distribution of some key variables (e.g., sales, volume, customer satisfaction) were first calculated. The run was very smooth, confirming that the dataset was of good quality.

This study entails depicting line graphs of sales over time, highlighting peak sales periods and seasonal trends i.e. sales trends. A bar chart showing the frequency of sales identifies the best selling products i.e. product popularity. Customer satisfaction can be seen by showing the distribution of satisfaction ratings for different store locations and purchasing methods in a box and line plot.
